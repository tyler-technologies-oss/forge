It can be common to nest form elements and buttons inside of the scaffold body content, which creates an invisible "edge" that clips outward focus indicators.`]}),`

`,e.jsxs(o.p,{children:["This is not necessarily a bug, or even specific to the ",e.jsx(o.code,{children:"<forge-scaffold>"}),", as it can happen on any element that has ",e.jsx(o.code,{children:"overflow: hidden"})," or ",e.jsx(o.code,{children:"overflow: auto"}),"."]}),`

to the element to ensure the focus indicator has enough space to be drawn (which means you may run into alignment issues with other related content on your page).`]}),`
