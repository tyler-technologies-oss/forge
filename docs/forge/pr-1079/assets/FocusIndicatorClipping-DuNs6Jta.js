It can be common to nest form elements and buttons inside of the scaffold body content, which creates an invisible "edge" that clips outward focus indicators.`]}),`

`,e.jsxs(o.p,{children:["This is not necessarily a bug, or even specific to the ",e.jsx(o.code,{children:"<forge-scaffold>"}),", as it can happen on any element that has ",e.jsx(o.code,{children:"overflow: hidden"})," or ",e.jsx(o.code,{children:"overflow: auto"}),"."]}),`

`,e.jsxs(o.p,{children:["To handle this situation, you can either set ",e.jsx(o.code,{children:"overflow: visible"})," on the element with the ",e.jsx(o.code,{children:'slot="body"'}),` attribute (which means you'd need to handle scrolling yourself), or add padding
to the element to ensure the focus indicator has enough space to be drawn (which means you may run into alignment issues with other related content on your page).`]}),`
