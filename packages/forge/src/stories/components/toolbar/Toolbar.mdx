<Title />

Toolbars are layout components that allow for placing content in named regions of its template.

This component is useful headers and footers within pages, dialogs, sections... etc. to ensure consistent spacing and positioning.

<Canvas of={ToolbarStories.Demo} />

> **Tip**: If you need the toolbar to expand vertically when its contents wrap, set either the `auto-height` attribute or the
> `--forge-toolbar-height: auto` CSS custom properties to override the static/fixed height.

## Inverted

You can use the `inverted` attribute for footers to move the border to the top.
