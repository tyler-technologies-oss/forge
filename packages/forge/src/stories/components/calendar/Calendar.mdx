The calendar component is used for selecting dates or displaying data related to dates in a small calendar format. It is commonly used in date pickers, date range pickers,
as well as standalone.

This is not a full-featured calendar component and it's not intended to be. The goal of this component is to be used in simple scenarios to allow for users to select dates or
data ranges, or for displaying basic events on important dates. For more complex scenarios, consider using a library such as [FullCalendar](https://fullcalendar.io/).
