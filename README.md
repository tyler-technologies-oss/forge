# Tyler Forge™

Welcome to Tyler Forge™, a design system and component library for building modern web applications.

Tyler Forge provides a set of UI components and styles that can be used to create consistent and accessible user interfaces. Forge is built using [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components), which are a set of web platform APIs that allow you to create new custom, reusable, encapsulated HTML tags to use in web pages just as you would with any other built-in HTML element. Web components are based on existing web standards, and can be used with any modern web framework or no framework at all.
