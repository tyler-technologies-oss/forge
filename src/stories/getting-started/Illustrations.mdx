# Illustrations

Tyler Forge provides a set of illustrations that can be used in your application. Illustrations are a key element of the Tyler brand system.
Illustrations provide a sense of personality and familiarity and can make complex ideas more accessible.

To learn more about Tyler Forge illustrations view the design system documentation [here][1].

### Library

The illustration library can also be viewed in the design system [here][2].

## Types

Tyler Forge illustrations are available in the following types:

- **Spot:** Use these small simple illustrations to convey meaning within a component such as a card. They’re used to add meaning, clarity, and visual intrigue.
- **Spot Hero:** Use these larger and more complex illustrations to communicate literal or metaphorical ideas within a limited space. They’re used for empty states, error messages, page headers, and larger card graphics.
- **Here:** Hero illustrations are more complex and heavy on narrative. They are interesting, engaging and usually feature people in order to tell a full story. Use them for larger content containers such as full width headers.

## Usage

Illustrations are just images in various formats such as `.svg`, `.png`, or `.jpg`.

### Example

You can use these images in your application via the `<img>` tag:

```html
<img src="https://cdn.forge.tylertech.com/v1/images/spot-hero/404-error-spot-hero.svg" alt="Illustration description" />
```

> **Important:** always provide an `alt` attribute for assistive technologies.

<img style={{ maxWidth: '320px' }} src="https://cdn.forge.tylertech.com/v1/images/spot-hero/404-error-spot-hero.svg" alt="404 Error" />
