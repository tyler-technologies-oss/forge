# Forge MCP Server

<div class="banner banner--warn">

ðŸš§ **Experimental** ðŸš§

The Tyler Forgeâ„¢ MCP Server is experimental and currently in developer preview. Please use it and provide feedback to help us improve it.

**Important**: Always validate AI-generated code and information for accuracy. LLMs can make assumptions and mistakes.

</div>

The Tyler Forgeâ„¢ MCP Server provides AI clients with direct access to Forge component documentation, design tokens, and code generation capabilities.
This experimental tool helps developers discover components, generate framework-specific examples, and follow best practices while building with Forge.

> **Key Principle**: While the MCP server significantly enhances AI assistance, always verify generated code, validate component usage, and test
> implementations thoroughly.

## Quick Setup

Get started with the Forge MCP server in your AI client:

### Claude Code
```bash
claude mcp add forge -- npx -y @tylertech/forge-mcp@latest
```

### VS Code

#### Command Palette
Open the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` or `Ctrl+Shift+P`) and run `MCP: Add Server...` and follow the instructions to add the `@tylertech/forge-mcp` npm package.

#### Manual Configuration
Create `.vscode/mcp.json`:
```json
{
  "servers": {
    "forge": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@tylertech/forge-mcp@latest"],
      "type": "stdio"
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note**: You may need to manually start the MCP server after updating your configuration.

### Claude Desktop
Add to your Claude Desktop configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "forge": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@tylertech/forge-mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Essential Tools

The MCP server provides these key capabilities:

- **Component Discovery**: `list_components`, `find_components`, `get_component_docs`
- **Design System Access**: `get_design_tokens`, `setup_typography`, `setup_icons`
- **Framework Integration**: `setup_framework` for Angular, React, Vue, etc.
- **Migration Guidance**: `get_version_migration_guide`

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Ask for specific components or use cases rather than general questions
2. **Validate Output**: Always review and test AI-generated code before implementation
3. **Provide Context**: Include your framework, version constraints, and specific requirements
4. **Break Down Complex Queries**: Split large requests into smaller, focused questions
5. **Cross-Reference Documentation**: Use the MCP server alongside official Forge documentation

## Example Usage

To get started with the Forge MCP server, try these example prompts to explore its capabilities:

```
"What forge components should I use to create a navigation sidebar?"

"Find components for creating a responsive form in React."

"Help me add a forge data table with sorting, filtering, and pagination to this page."

"Help me upgrade this page from Forge v2 to v3."
```

**Important**: The above prompts are just basic examples to get started. Tailor your queries to your needs and context, and **be specific**. If you
know what you need and can provide details to guide the LLM, do so. The more information you provide, the better the results.

## Contributing

Found issues or have suggestions? The Tyler Forgeâ„¢ MCP Server is open source and welcomes contributions:

- **Repository**: [tyler-technologies-oss/forge-mcp](https://github.com/tyler-technologies-oss/forge-mcp)
- **Issues**: Report bugs and request features

### Documentation

The MCP server will only be as good as its documentation. If you find gaps or areas for improvement, please contribute to the docs via the MCP
[markdown templates](https://github.com/tyler-technologies-oss/forge-mcp/tree/main/templates), or directly in the [Forge repository](https://github.com/tyler-technologies-oss/forge)
where the API docs are generated from.
