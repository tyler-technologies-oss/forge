# Forge Components

Forge is a project that produces framework-agnostic Web Components for the browser. The components adhere to the standard W3C Web Components
spec, and work seamlessly with the various front-end frameworks such as Angular, Vue, and React, as well as no framework at all.

The goal of this project is to create a set of high quality UI components for the browser platform that implement the [Tyler Forge](https://forge.tylertech.com/)
design system. The components can be shared across products and applications without requiring a specific version of a framework. This will help
applications present themselves and function consistently, regardless of underlying architecture/technology.

The components within this library derive from Google's Material design system, but are optimized for a more dense design by default. They are highly
customizable and themeable, as well as provide a vast amount of configuration through the components APIs.

To get started using Forge within your application, please check out our [getting started](?path=/story/overview-getting-started--page) guide.
