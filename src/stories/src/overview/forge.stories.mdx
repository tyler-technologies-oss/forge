# Forge Components

Forge is a framework-agnostic library of Web Components adhering to the [W3C Web Component Spec][2] and the [Forge Design System][1]. Originally derived from Google's
[Material Components Web][3] project (MDC), this project aims to create a consistent UI/UX across applications regardless of choice in front-end frameworks. Theming is a
core part of the library such that competing design objectives can be achieved while still providing UI/UX cohesion across product catalogs. Please visit the
[Forge Design System website][1] for additional guidance and documentation.

To view more information, see the "Guides" section in the menu and to view component demos and documentation view the "Components" section.
