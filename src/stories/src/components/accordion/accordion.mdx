# Accordion

This component does not provide any visual appearance. It is just an orchestrator of child `<forge-expansion-panel>` components.

The `<forge-accordion>` will ensure that only **one** child expansion panel, at most, is open at any given time. If you need to 
allow for multiple panels to be opened simultaneously, you should opt for using just multiple `<forge-expansion-panel>`
components together without an accordion wrapper.

See the [expansion panel component](?path=/story/components-expansion-panel--default) for information on how
to use that component separately.
