# Backdrop

The backdrop component is intended to be used as a background behind modal elements, such as the dialog for example. You will
almost always use this component as part of the composition that makes up other larger components, but it's exposed from the library
for cases where another library or application needs to make use of it.

You typically would use a backdrop when you want to prevent access to elements behind the modal element, as well as draw focus from
the user to a specific modal surface area of the screen.

## Accessibility

- Ensure that when a backdrop is in use that navigation on modal elements is still possible via the keyboard.
  - Ideally elements behind the backdrop should not be navigable, but that's more of a responsibility for the modal element.
- Ensure any methods used to dismiss the backdrop can still be accessed via the keyboard.
