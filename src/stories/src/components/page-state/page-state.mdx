# Page state

The page-state component is a layout design component that was created to ensure consistency, and provide structure for pages that need to
display a state such as empty, error, 404... etc. This will allow us to keep all of our pages that are using this pattern the same.

These states will typically be the only content on the page, and they provide a clear description, with optional actions to take when the user
reaches the state.

> The page-state component has built-in margins, and support for mobile layouts.

## Accessibility

- If the graphic is important to the communication of the page state, ensure it has an `alt` attribute which describes the graphic, otherwise include an `alt` attribute with an empty value (`alt=""`)
- If any action buttons are included, verify that they have a [role](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques) attribute set.
