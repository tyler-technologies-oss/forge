# Button

The button component is nothing more than a wrapper around the native `<button>` element. It provides default styles, as well as manages the
ripple effect on the button. Along with that, you can adjust the button via the API provided through the component.

## Example

Below are common variants that the button component supports. The `<button>` element is left available to the developer to easily allow for binding and
adjusting native properties/attributes as needed.

### Default

<LiveDemo dense codeHtml={ButtonDefaultCodeHtml()}>
  <ButtonDemo />
</LiveDemo>

### With icon

Make note of the `<span>` used around the button text, this is required to properly space out the icons since this component does not use shadow DOM (yet).

<LiveDemo dense codeHtml={ButtonWithIconCodeHtml()}>
  <ButtonDemo type="outlined" hasTrailingIcon />
</LiveDemo>

> **Note:** To make a button fill 100% of its available width, put the `<forge-button>` inside a block element and set
> the width of both the `<forge-button>` component and its embedded `<button>` element to 100%.

## Accessibility

- Verify that you can reach every button by keyboard navigation.
    - Ensure that there is a visual cue that the button is currently in focus.
- Verify that pressing the space bar or enter key while focused on a button will activate the button in the same manner as if it had been clicked with a mouse.
- Be sure to include a role attribute to indicate to screen readers what the button is being used for.
- Verify that there is sufficient contrast between the foreground text and background to meet WCAG requirements.
