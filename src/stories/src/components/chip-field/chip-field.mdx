# Chip field

The chip field wraps a label, input and a collection of chips (or other elements if desired) with a set of exposed events you'll use for managing your
collection. It is used to provide users with an easy way to manage collections of simple data, like managing emails, or users by name.

It should not be used for data that is too complex to provide a simple short descriptor for. If you cannot create a short, 1-2 word descriptor for your
data or it requires more than one field to provide the context to the user, consider managing your collection through the [list component](?path=/story/components-list--default)
instead.

The chip field component can be composed together with the [autocomplete component](?path=/story/components-autocomplete--default) to
provide additional type ahead functionality.

> Use a debounce when actions can occur after a user stops typing. In cases where an HTTP request is fired, or some other long running task occurs, avoid executing those expensive tasks until the user has completed what they are searching for. Forge recommends a debounce of 500ms.

## Examples

The main idea to keep in mind when using this component is that the chip-field will let you know via its events that a chip is to be added/removed. It's up
to you to handle creating the chips that display within the field itself. This allows for flexibility in how these are managed, while also leaving it up to
you to provide the content for the chips as well as the accessibility.

### Simple

<LiveDemo layout="column" fullWidth codeHtml={ChipFieldDefaultHtml()} codeTs={ChipFieldDefaultTs()}>
  <ChipFieldDemo />
</LiveDemo>

> **Note:** The `type="field"` attribute added to the chip in the JavaScript. This is a special variant of the `<forge-chip>` component made specifically to be
> used with the `<forge-chip-field>` component. It has a slimmer `dense` profile as well as a few other internal differences that allow it to work well with form fields.

### Autocomplete

The chip-field can be composed together with the autocomplete to provide suggestions to the user as they type. This allows for a great user experience,
while also still allowing for flexibility based on your requirements.

Please see the [with autocomplete](?path=/story/components-chip-field--with-autocomplete) demo to see this in action!

## Accessibility

- Add an `id` to your `<input>` element and bind it to your `<label>` element using the `for` attribute on the `<label>`.
- Ensure that the chips that are added to the field have descriptive `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` attributes.
- Make sure that the member chips that are added can be accessed via the keyboard left and right arrows.
  - There should be a distinct visual cue that indicates which chip is focused
- Similarly, make sure that when a chip is focused using the arrow keys, that the backspace and delete keys do remove them.
- Ensure that when disabled, the entire field as well as the member chips all appear visually and interactively disabled.
