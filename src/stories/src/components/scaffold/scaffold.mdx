# Scaffold

The scaffold component is intended to be used as a layout tool. You can use it for your full application layout, or even nest scaffolds within other scaffolds. Think of this component as a structural tool (it uses CSS grid under the hood) with named locations that allow you render any element you want in those named locations.

> **Note:** The scaffold handles common page layouts, but itâ€™s simply a wrapper around native CSS `grid` styles to aid in common application layouts. We recommend that you become familiar with `flexbox` and `grid` for scenarios where you cannot use the scaffold. Suggested learning resources:

> - [MDN: Basics of Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox)

Using a scaffold will help you place elements in pre-defined locations within a layout. This makes it very easy to spin up common layouts without having
to write any CSS at all. For instance, by placing content within the built-in slots the component will handle overflowing content for you.

> **Note:** It is recommended that you use a single container element for each slot within the scaffold. This
> is because the scaffold applies specific CSS grid styles to the slotted elements, and this can cause unwanted
> side-effects to your elements if you place things like multiple buttons directly into the root of the slots themselves.
>
> If you encounter rendering issues where content is stacked on the z-index, ensure that each named slot is used only once.
