# Popup

The popup component is a generic component that is intended to contain developer-provider content to render. It contains smart positioning logic to ensure that it is
always visible on-screen, as well as to allow for adjusting the desired position around the element that it is attached to.

Popups are almost always triggered by another element on the page, and will likely be positioned around that element when open.

> The popup component will be added to the bottom of the `<body>` element by default, and use absolute positioning to attach it to its target element.
>
> **Note:** you can adjust where the popup is placed in the DOM by adding a `forge-popup-host` attribute to any parent element of the target element.

This component is typically used as an internal utility for other components such as the select, autocomplete, menu... etc. but you can use it on its own
to show your own content in a small floating element.

## Example

Popups typically aren't created in the DOM directly, but they can be created dynamically using JavaScript:

<LiveDemo fullWidth layout="column" codeTs={PopupDefaultTs()}>
  <PopupDemo />
</LiveDemo>

> **Note:** setting the `open` property to `true` will append the `<forge-popup>` element to the DOM for you.

Once in the DOM, the popup will look something like the following (and will appear at the bottom of the `<body>` by default):

```html
<forge-popup>Popup content</forge-popup>
```

If you'd like to adjust which element the a popup will be attached to, just add a `forge-popup-host` attribute or `forge-popup-host` class to any parent element
of the target element. Just be sure to add `position: relative;` to the same element to ensure that the popup can be positioned relative to the new host.

### Angular

The `@tylertech/forge-angular` adapter library offers an easy-to-use Angular directive for showing popups. This makes it extremely easy to show
your own custom popups and it's highly recommended that you use to to make your life easier.

The following example shows how to use a popup all through Angular's template syntax using `<ng-template>`:

```html
<forge-button type="raised">
  <!-- Use the forgePopup directive and set its value equal to the name of the template specified below -->
  <button #popup="forgePopup" [forgePopup]="popupTemplate" (click)="popup.open()" forgePopupCloseOnBlur="true">Show popup</button>
</forge-button>

<!-- Use ng-template to allow for embedding this template in the dynamically generated popup -->
<ng-template #popupTemplate>
  <div>
    <div>Popup Content</div>
    <forge-button>
      <button (click)="popup.close()">Close</button>
    </forge-button>
  </div>
</ng-template>
```

> The directive is responsible for dynamically creating an embedded view to place in the popup, while preserving the binding context of the location where the template is defined.

## Properties/Attributes

<PropertyDef name="targetElement" type="HTMLElement" attr={false} defaultValue="undefined">

Sets the HTML element that the popup will be positioned around.

</PropertyDef>

<PropertyDef name="placement" type="PopupPlacement" defaultValue="&quot;bottom-start&quot;">

The placement of the popup around the target element.

See the [PopupPlacement](#popupplacement) type below for information about other acceptable values.

</PropertyDef>

<PropertyDef name="fallbackPlacements" type="PopupPlacement[]" defaultValue="[]">

The fallback placements to prefer around the target element when `placement` causes the element to be clipped.

By default the component will try all available placements for a "best-fit" strategy, but overriding this value to a sub-set of those
can be valuable when you only want the popup to fall back to specific placements of your choosing.

See the [PopupPlacement](#popupplacement) type below for acceptable values.

</PropertyDef>

<PropertyDef name="open" type="boolean" defaultValue="false">

Controls the visibility of the popup.

</PropertyDef>

<PropertyDef name="manageFocus" type="boolean" defaultValue="false">

Controls whether the popup will capture and restore focus automatically or not.

</PropertyDef>

<PropertyDef name="animationType" type="PopupAnimationType" defaultValue="&quot;none&quot;">

Controls what style of animation the popup will use as it opens/closes.

</PropertyDef>

<PropertyDef name="static" type="boolean" defaultValue="false">

Controls how the popup will emit and listen for focus/blur events. If set to `true`, the popup will stay open until explicitly told to close.

</PropertyDef>

<PropertyDef name="offset" type="IPopupPosition" defaultValue="{ x: 0, y: 0 }">

Controls the exact positioning of the popup.

</PropertyDef>

<PropertyDef name="openCallback" type="() => void | Promise<void>" defaultValue="undefined">

Sets a callback that will be exceuted just prior to the popup opening.

By using this callback, you can get notified and control whether the popup can open or not.

</PropertyDef>

<PropertyDef name="closeCallback" type="() => void | Promise<void>" defaultValue="undefined">

Sets a callback that will be exceuted just prior to the popup closing after it has been opened.

By using this callback, you can get notified and control whether the popup can close or not.

</PropertyDef>

<PropertyDef name="hideWhenClipped" type="boolean" defaultValue="false">

Gets/sets whether the popup will automatically hide itself when the target element is scrolled out of view.

</PropertyDef>

<PropertyDef name="constrain-viewport-width" prop={false} type="boolean" defaultValue="''">

Controls whether the host element will have a `max-width` applied or not.

</PropertyDef>

## Accessibility

- Ensure that all of the controls that are accessible by a mouse are also accessible by keyboard.
  - Ensure the controls are reachable by the tab key.
  - Ensure each control can be updated or activated by the keyboard.
- This component is typically detached from the element that it is positioned around in the DOM. Due to this, the usage of `aria-owns` on the target element will ensure that the popup is always related to the target element as if they were together.
  - If you use this component on its own, be sure to add a unique `id` attribute and bind it to the target element using `aria-owns` on the target element.
