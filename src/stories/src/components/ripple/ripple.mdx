# Ripple

The ripple component is a simple component that allows for you to easily attach a Material-styled "ripple" effect to any arbitrary element.
This component encapsulates the management of the effect, as well as its visual styles into an easy-to-use Web Component.

## Example

### Basic

The `<forge-ripple>` component can attach to any element. Here we show it attached to a simple `<div>` element via the `target` attribute:

<LiveDemo layout="column" codeHtml={RippleDefaultHtml()}>
  <RippleDemo />
</LiveDemo>

> **Note:** This component will automatically attach to its direct parent element if no `target` attribute is specified.

### Card

It's common that this component is used together with the [card component](?path=/story/components-card--default) to provide an interactive card.

<LiveDemo layout="column" codeHtml={RippleCardRecipeHtml()}>
  <WithCardDemo />
</LiveDemo>

## Accessibility

The ripple component itself is just a visual effect on an existing element and therefore only needs to provide colors that pass contrast ratio
requirements, which is handled internally by the component. The element that the component is attached to however needs to provide various
accessibility features. For example, if you are attaching the ripple to an arbitrary `<div>` or `<forge-card>` (or any element that isn't typically
in the natural tab order of the page), then you need to ensure this element is interpreted properly.

- Ensure that any elements this attached to receive the proper `role` attribute, commonly `role="button"`.
- If the element can be disabled, be sure to apply the `aria-disabled="true"` attribute.
- Always provide an `aria-label` or `aria-describedby` attribute to help users determine what the element is intended to be used for.
- Ensure that the element is available in the tab order by providing a `tabindex="0"` attribute.

> **Note:** using the ripple with an element to convert it into a button is a common usage. Be sure to follow the guidance noted above in this case.
