# Icon

This component is intended to be used with SVG icons only via the `@tylertech/tyler-icons` package. By installing that package into your application,
you gain the ability to import only the icons your application is using and include the icons with your application code.

To use an icon, you will import it and define it in the built-in `IconRegistry`. This makes the icon available to your whole application, and
allow you to reference icons by their name and the component will take care of the rest.

> This is the preferred format for including icons in your application vs referencing the font-based icons from the Forge CDN.

## Library

If you're wondering which icons are available to you and how to load those icons into your application, head over to the
Forge [icon library](https://forge.tylertech.com/core-components/iconography/library) and choose the "SVG" option to see
all available icons. From there you can copy code snippets and paste them directly into your application.

## Conversion

If you are looking to convert from using font-based icons to SVG-based icons with the `<forge-icon>` element, the process is relatively simple and if done
correctly you will notice no difference between the two once complete.

1. The first step in this process is to make sure to include this icon component in your application by defining it:

   ```ts
   import { defineIconComponent } from '@tylertech/forge';

   defineIconComponent();
   ```

2. Swap out an existing font-based icon with the new icon element structure:

   **Old**

   ```html
   <i class="tyler-icons">face</i>
   ```

   **New**

   ```html
   <forge-icon name="face"></forge-icon>
   ```

3. Import the desired icon(s) into your application, and define it within the Forge icon registry:

   ```ts
   import { IconRegistry } from '@tylertech/forge';
   import { tylIconFace } from '@tylertech/tyler-icons/standard';

   IconRegistry.define(tylIconFace);
   ```

   > **Note:** this should be done as early in your application bootstrapping process as possible. Make sure all icons are defined, prior to the page rendering or else the
   > component will not be able to find the icon data when it is instantiated.

## Example

This component can be used with the local icon registry, or by loading the icons dynamically from the CDN.

### Icon registry

This is the most common, and expected usage of this component. Import the icons your application needs, and reference them by name:

<LiveDemo 
layout="column" 
codeHtml={IconRegistryCodeHtml()} 
codeTs={IconRegistryCodeTs()}>
   <RegistryDemo/>
</LiveDemo>

The above example shows how to include an icon from each set and define within the registry.

> This will include the icon SVG content within your application code bundle. Tree shaking will occur to exclude all unused icons from the `@tylertech/tyler-icons` package.

### External

If your application cannot statically determine the name of the icon to use at build time, you may need to use the CDN as a fallback to load the icons dynamically. Just
set the `external` attribute to toggle this mode on:

<LiveDemo 
layout="column" 
codeHtml={IconExternalCodeHtml()}>
  <ExternalDemo/>
</LiveDemo>

> **Important:** the default icon set that the component will load icons from is the **"standard"** set. If you need to load an icon from the "external" or "custom" sets,
> just set the `external-type` attribute to the corresponding icon set name:
>
> ```html
> <forge-icon name="action_launcher" external-type="custom"></forge-icon>
> ```

### External (self-hosted)

If you need to host the SVG files on your own server rather than using the public Forge CDN, you can configure the icon component to use a callback that will
allow you to provide a custom icon URL based on your server structure.

```ts
iconElement.externalUrlBuilder = (name, type) => {
  return `https://your-custom-domain.com/${type}/${name}.svg`;
};
```

### Styling

The SVG icons can still be styled as if they were any other normal font on the page:

<LiveDemo 
layout="column" 
codeHtml={IconStylesCodeHtml()} 
codeScss={IconStylesCodeScss()} 
codeTs={IconStylesCodeTs()}>
   <StylesDemo/>
</LiveDemo>


> The icons are also themeable by default and will continue to work seamlessly with the standard CSS custom properties used within Forge.

Sets the raw SVG string content directly. You can use this property in place of the icon registry if you have access to the raw SVG string.
  
</PropertyDef>

<PropertyDef name="lazy" type="boolean" defaultValue="false">

Gets/sets whether the icon data will be loaded on the page dynamically as it comes into view.
  
</PropertyDef>

<PropertyDef name="external" type="boolean" defaultValue="false">

Gets/sets whether the icon will be loaded from the CDN as a fallback if it doesn't exist in the local icon registry.
  
> Use this if you cannot statically determine the icon at design time.

</PropertyDef>

<PropertyDef name="externalType" type="IconExternalType" defaultValue={"\"standard\""}>

Gets/sets the name of the icon set to use when loading an icon externally. Valid values `"standard"` (default), `"extended"`, `"custom"`.
  
</PropertyDef>

<PropertyDef name="externalUrlBuilder" attr={false} type="IconUrlBuilder" defaultValue="undefined">

Sets the callback to use when determining the external URL to make a request to if the desired icon is not available in the local icon registry.
  
</PropertyDef>

<PropertyDef name="viewbox" type="IconUrlBuilder" defaultValue="undefined">

A custom value to apply to the `viewBox` attribute on the internal `<svg>` element.
  
</PropertyDef>

## CSS custom properties

| Name                                            | Description
| :-----------------------------------------------| :--------------------
| `--forge-icon-theme-color`                        | Controls the color.
| `--forge-icon-font-size`                          | Controls the font size. The standard `font-size` style can be set directly on the `<forge-icon>` element, but use this custom property to apply to multiple icons if desired.
