# Guide: Component tutorial

In the following guide we will create a new Forge Web Component using the CLI utility, and add some functionality to it to
make it do something interesting. This component will be a simple component that doesn't do anything spectacular, but it will
introduce you to the Forge component development process, architecture, and all of the various patterns that you'll need to
use when developing more complex components or modifying an existing component.

> **Important:** The following commands must be run within a Forge Web Component project. It assumes that you have either 
> already installed the Forge CLI tool on your machine (for which you will use to generate a new blank Forge project) or you
> have cloned the existing Forge repository (recommended).

It is **recommended** that you read the [component architecture](?path=/story/guides-component-architecture--page) page before continuing
to make sure that you are up to speed on terminology and archicture best practices.

## Tutorial (optional)

If you are working directly in the standard Forge repository, then you can continue on to step 1. If you'd like to 
create a new empty Forge project, please run the following command and follow the prompts:

```bash
forge new
```

> This command requires that you have installed the `forge` CLI on your machine globally:
> `npm install -g @tylertech/forge-cli --registry https://tylertech.jfrog.io/artifactory/api/npm/npm/`

### Step 1: Generate the component

The component we are going to create is simply going to be a square that allows the user to click on it, causing the
square to choose a random color for itself. It will emit an event to the consumer letting them know when that happens.

This simple component will expose you to most of the necessary patterns that you'll need to follow in larger, more
complex components going forward. Let's dive in!

> Tip: run the command `forge help` for info about all of the commands available in the CLI.

The first thing we're going to do is generate a new Web Component using the Forge CLI tool:

```bash
npx forge generate component color-square
```

> **Note:** we're using `npx` here because the Forge CLI is installed as a dependency within each Forge project, and this
> will ensure that you're using the compatible CLI version for your project.

At this point, you should see a new directory within the `src/lib` directory called `color-square`.

Let's get to know the files that were just created for us:

* **color-square.ts**
  * This is the custom element class.
  * Instantiates the foundation and adapter
  * Imports your HTML template and CSS styles.
  * Uses Shadow DOM by default.
* **color-square-foundation.ts**
  * This is the class for controlling the business logic of your web component.
  * Should only contain state and component logic, and should **never** communicate directly with the DOM.
* **color-square-adapter.ts**
  * This is the DOM adapter. The only responsibility of this class is to communicate with the DOM of your component for read/write operations.
  * It's best practice to allocate references to the elements you communicate with often from your template within the constructor of this class.
* **color-square-constants.ts**
  * Contains all constant values used across the component.
  * Defines the custom element name.
  * Put all constant strings, numbers, selectors, class names, event names... etc. here for easy access within your component classes, as well as by consumers of your library.
* **color-square.html**
  * This is the component template that will be placed in the Shadow DOM.
  * It is required to wrap all content in `<template>` tags.
* **color-square.scss**
  * This is the Sass stylesheet for defining the selectors that your component will use to style its template.
  * Where possible, use variables, mixins, and functions for style content so that it is reusable.
  * **Note:** use Sass modules (`@use` instead of `@import`) for better separation and organization of your styles.
* **_mixins.scss**
  * The Sass partial that contains all mixins.
  * Imported in `color-square.scss`.
* **_variables.scss**
  * The Sass partial that contains all variables.
  * Imported in `_mixins.scss`.
* **index.ts**
  * This is the main entry point that defines the public members for this module.
  * Exports a component definition function that can be used to register this specific custom element with the browser.

### Step 2: Add state to the foundation

We need to allow for setting the color of our component. This will be done by adding a state property to our foundation class.
  
Add a getter/setter property and backing field to the `ColorSquareFoundation` class to hold the color state value:

```ts expanded
private _color: string;

public get color(): string {
  return this._color;
}

public set color(value: string) {
  if (this._color !== value) {
    this._color = value;
  }
}
```

> Note: It's important that you check for value equality in the setter to ensure that when we mirror this value to an attribute
> later on in the tutorial, that we don't cause an infinite loop.

### Step 3: Add a property to the public API of the component

Add a property to the `ColorSquareComponent` class to expose a public API on the component that can be used to set the color via JavaScript.

```ts expanded
// Always define all public properties in the component interface as well
interface IColorSquareComponent {
  color: string;
}

public get color(): string {
  return this._foundation.color;
}

public set color(value: string) {
  this._foundation.color = value;
}
```

> You'll notice that the component will just get/set properties within the foundation. This is an important pattern to
> allow for the ability to reuse the foundation class if necessary. The custom element class should **never** hold state.

### Step 4: Accept input via HTML attributes

Modify the `observedAttributes` property of the `ColorSquareComponent` class to add a `color` value to the array. It will
accept a string value for the color to display.

> Properties that contain primitive types of data should always have a corresponding attribute available. Any complex types
> such as arrays or objects, should NOT have a corresponding attribute to avoid losing the reference to those objects.
>
> Complex types should only be set via the public JavaScript API for the component.

```ts
public static get observedAttributes() {
  return [COLOR_SQUARE_CONSTANTS.attributes.COLOR];
}
```

Notice the use of the constants to access the name of the color attribute. Always reference all strings as constants.

### Step 5: React to changing attribute values

Modify the `attributeChangedCallback` lifecycle method to react to the changing of the `color` attribute.

```ts expanded
public attributeChangedCallback(name: string, oldValue: string, newValue: string): void {
  switch(name) {
    case COLOR_SQUARE_CONSTANTS.attributes.COLOR:
      this.color = newValue;
      break;
  }
} 
```

### Step 6: Use the adapter to communicate with the DOM

Add code to the `ColorSquareAdapter` class to adjust the color of the square in the DOM.

```ts expanded
import { getShadowElement } from '@tylertech/forge-core';

export interface IColorSquareAdapter {
  setColor(color: string): void;
}

export class ColorSquareAdapter implements IColorSquareAdapter {
  private _container: HTMLElement;

  constructor(private _component: IColorSquareComponent) {
    this._container = getShadowElement(_component, COLOR_SQUARE_CONSTANTS.selectors.CONTAINER);
  }

  public setColor(color: string): void {
    this._container.style.backgroundColor = color;
  }
} 
```

> Take note of the `constructor` and how it finds the element within the template. This element reference is used for
> convenience when accessing that element in the future. The use of the `getShadowElement` from `@tylertech/forge-core`
> is used as a convenience method for finding elements within a components' Shadow DOM.

### Step 7: Call adapter method from foundation

Adjust the `color` setter property in the `ColorSquareFoundation` class to call the new `setColor` method on the adapter.

```ts expanded
public set color(value: string) {
  if (this._color !== value) {
    this._color = value;
    this._adapter.setColor(this._color);
  }
}
```

> The default adapter is useful when writing unit tests for the foundation.

### Step 8: Set up component template

Update the HTML template (`color-square.html`) with the container element.

```html
<template>
  <div class="forge-color-square"></div>
</template>
```

### Step 9: Create reusable Sass variables

Update the `_variables.scss` file to contain variables that define anything you'd like to be reusable or available
externally for consumers.

```scss
$height: 100px;
$width: 100px;
```

> It's not necessary to make Sass variables for every value, but the general rule of thumb is that if you were to reuse
> that value anywhere, or if you want to allow for the value to be imported by a consumer of your library, then you should
> make it a variable.

### Step 10: Create reusable Sass mixin

Update the `_mixins.scss` file to contain a new mixin that you will use as the base for creating a styled color-square component.

We will consume this mixin in the `color-square.scss` file next.

```scss
@mixin base() {
  display: inline-block;
  height: $forge-color-square-height;
  width: $forge-color-square-height;
}
```

### Step 11: Create component styles

Add a selector for your main container `<div>` using the mixin you just created. Do this in your `color-square.scss` file.
This file defines the styles that are scoped to the Shadow DOM of your component only.

```scss
.forge-color-square {
  @include base;
}
```

> It is best practice to name all classes, mixins, and variables with a prefix of `forge-` for consistency, as well as
> knowing that they belong to the Tyler namespace.

### Step 12: Define your component with the library

Open the `src/lib/index.ts` file, and adjust the array passed to `defineCustomElements`. This will allow for your
component to be registered with the browser when the consumer wants to register the library as whole.

```ts expanded
import { ColorSquareComponent } from './color-square';

...

const CUSTOM_ELEMENTS = [
  // Custom element classes to register
  ColorSquareComponent
];

export function defineComponents(): void {
  defineCustomElements(CUSTOM_ELEMENTS);
}
```

### Step 13: Use custom element in the demo app

Open the `src/demo/index.html` file, and add a tag for your custom element:

```html
<forge-color-square color="red"></forge-color-square>
```

> If you chose to use a different element prefix (you can always refer to the `src/lib/constants.ts` file to view your
> prefix) then you will want to replace the `forge-` with your own prefix in the previous example.

### Step 14: Serve the demo app

To serve the demo app, run the following command and the site will be displayed in your default browser. If you have any
errors those will be displayed during the build in your command line at this time.

#### Next steps
  * Add a `click` listener to the component that will randomly generate and set a new color when the user clicks on the square.
  * Emit a `CustomEvent` from the component that contains the new randomly generated color.
  * Create a listener within the demo app that can listen for the `CustomEvent` from the component, and display the random color in the console.

### Step 15: Add a click listener

Typically you will want to register any event listeners within the `constructor` of your foundation class. As long as your
template has been created before the instantiation of your foundation class, then this is a safe place to access the template.

The following code will ask our adapter to create a `click` listener on our color-square root elemnent `<div>`.

```ts
constructor(private _adapter: IColorSquareComponent) {
  this._adapter.addClickListener(evt => this._onClick(evt));
}
```

Now we will create our `_onClick` method where we can generate and set a new random color.

```ts expanded
private _onClick(evt: Event): void {
  const color = this._generateRandomColor();
  this._adapter.setColor(color);
}

private _generateRandomColor(): string {
  return '#' + Math.random().toString(16).slice(2, 8).toUpperCase();
}
```

Finally we can implement the `addClickListener` method on our adapter.

```ts
public addClickListener(callback: (evt: Event) =&gt; void): void {
  this._container.addEventListener('click', callback);
}
```

At this point once all of your files are saved, the demo app should refresh. You can click the colored square and watch it
randomly change colors.

### Step 16: Emit a `CustomEvent`

In this step we will emit a `CustomEvent` that contains the randomly generated color from the previous step when clicked.

First we will add a new constant value that contains the name of our `CustomEvent` type:

```ts expanded
// Create a new variable that will hold a map of our event names
const events = {
  COLOR: `${COMPONENT_NAME_PREFIX}color`
};

// Ensure that the propery is exported in the constants variable
export const COLOR_SQUARE_CONSTANTS = {
  ...
  events
};
```

Now add a call to our adapter to emit the event from our `_onClick` method:

```ts
private _onClick(evt: Event): void {
  const color = this._generateRandomColor();
  this._adapter.setColor(color);
  this._adapter.emitEvent(COLOR_SQUARE_CONSTANTS.events.COLOR, color);
}
```

Implement the `emitEvent` method within the adapter class.

> Don't forget to add the method to the `IColorSquareAdapter` interface.

```ts
import { emitEvent } from '@tylertech/forge-core';

public emitEvent(type: string, data: any): void {
  emitEvent(this._component, type, data);
}
```

> Note the use of a convenience method called `emitEvent` from the `@tylertech/forge-core` package. This encapsulates
> the logic for creating a `CustomEvent`, and provides cross-browser compatibility.

### Step 17: Listen for the event

Now we can add an event listener to the `<forge-color-square>` element in the demo app.

Add a new `<script>` tag to the bottom of the body (anywhere after the color square element). This will find our color
`<forge-square-element>`, listen for the `forge-color-square-color` event, and print out the value of the new random color to the browser 
dev console.

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
  const colorSquare = document.querySelector('forge-color-square');
  colorSquare.addEventListener('forge-color-square-color', evt => {
    console.log('[forge-color-square] forge-color-square-color event:', evt.detail);
  });
</script>
```

> Note: If you changed from the default element prefix, be sure to update the event name and element name to match the
> prefix you chose for your library.
