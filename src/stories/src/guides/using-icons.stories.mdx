# Guide: Using icons

The icons provided by Tyler Forge are available in multiple formats. It's important to know the difference between all
available formats, and when/how to use each.

We distribute the icons using both an npm package, and via static files hosted on our CDN.

> It's important to note that we follow a "never delete" principle when it comes to hosting icons in the CDN. You can safely assume 
> that those icons will always be available under the same static URL.

### NPM

The recommended way to consume icons is through the npm package. This allows the icons to be exported as a JavaScript
module that can allow applications to take advantage of techniques such as tree shaking to import only the icons they need
to use, and leave out the rest. The other main benefits of this are that versioning becomes easier, and the icons are distributed
in the more flexible SVG format.

See the [implementation details](#cdn-1) below for more information about using this approach.

> This method requires that your application supports ES modules, or the addition of a custom build process may be required.

### CDN

An alternative option to leverage the icon libraries available in Forge is to use the CDN (Content Delivery Network). The Forge
CDN is a publicly accessible, static asset server that allows you to reference icons (and many other types of assets) without
hosting them yourself in each application. This makes file access very fast, as well as aiding in caching of the assets on a
users machine as they navigate across products and applications that utilize the same assets.

There are two formats that you can choose to consume icons in your application when using the CDN, font-based and SVG-based.

* **SVG** (recommended)

  The full set of icons are available through the use of individual SVG files. This format offers the ability to reference each icon that
  your application needs on a case-by-case basis. This improves processing time dramatically to help speed up loading times for your app.

* **Font**

  The font files contain **every** icon in the library, but are distributed as three separate files, one for each icon set.

  Font-based icons are easier to use, but they come at a **cost**. Large font icon files take longer to process by the browser which can cause
  a noticeable delay when rendering your application. We have chosen to **deprecate** the font files, and our recommended approach is SVG.

## Implementation

Below you'll find examples and information regarding the implementation of consuming the icons using your desired format.

### NPM

To get started using this format, install the `@tylertech/tyler-icons` npm package.

This package only contains SVG icons that are distributed as importable JavaScript constants. It's expected that you will use these
icons with the [icon component](?path=/docs/components-icon--default) to easily render them. This means you can define
each component with the Forge icon registry to easily choose the icons that your application is using, the rest will be ignored and tree
shaken away!

After installing the `@tylertech/tyler-icons` package into your project, you can then import and define the icons you want to use with
the Forge icon registry.

> **Important:** the icons are separated out by the following directories in the package:
>
> * standard: The official Google Material icons.
> * extended: The community-based Material icons.
> * custom: Tyler-owned custom icons.
>
> Be sure to import icons from the corresponding directory within the package.

```ts expanded
import { tylIconAccountCircle, tylIconFace } from '@tylertech/tyler-icons/standard';
import { tylIconAccountDetails } from '@tylertech/tyler-icons/extended';
import { tylIconActionLauncher } from '@tylertech/tyler-icons/custom';
import { IconRegistry } from '@tylertech/forge';

constructor() {
  IconRegistry.define([
    tylIconAccountCircle,
    tylIconFace,
    tylIconAccountDetails,
    tylIconActionLauncher
  ]);
}
```

Now you can use this icon name with the `<forge-icon>` component, and the icon data will be loaded from the registry:

```html
<forge-icon name="face"></forge-icon>
```

> **Note:** A common location to when using JavaScript classes is to define the icons in your constructor. This ensures that minifiers don't inadvertantly
> assume this is dead code. Just be sure to define your icons as early as you can when rendering your application.

You can also load icons dynamically (without defining them locally) by using the external CDN. Just set the `external`
attribute to enable the component to make a request to the CDN to fetch the icon data dynamically (if not exists in the
local registry):

```html
<forge-icon name="face" external external-type="standard"></forge-icon>
```

> If not using the standard icon set, be sure to specify an icon set name in the value of the `external-type` attribute. Valid values: "standard" (default), "extended", "custom".

A property by the name of `externalUrlBuilder` exists on the component which can be set to a callback that will be executed when the
component is creating the URL to fetch the icon from. This gives you control over hosting the icons yourself elsewhere from the public
CDN if desired.

### CDN

There are two options for consumption when it comes to the CDN. You can choose to reference the SVG files, or the CSS stylesheets for loading the font-based icons.

* **CSS**

  To include the font-based icons in your application, you must load a stylesheet from the CDN and use the proper CSS class for each set.

  * **Standard**: https://cdn.forge.tylertech.com/v1/css/tyler-icons-standard.css
    * Use the `tyler-icons` class: ex. `<i class="tyler-icons">alarm</i>`
  * **Extended**: https://cdn.forge.tylertech.com/v1/css/tyler-icons-extended.css
    * Use the `tyler-icons-ext` class: ex. `<i class="tyler-icons-ext">account</i>`
  * **Custom**: https://cdn.forge.tylertech.com/v1/css/tyler-icons-custom.css
    * Use the `tyler-icons-custom` class: ex. `<i class="tyler-icons-custom">decision_tree</i>`

  > It's important to differentiate which icon set your icon is coming from. Pay close attention to which set it belongs to, and use the proper CSS class to reference it.


* **SVG**

  The same icons that are available in the `@tylertech/tyler-icons` npm package are also available in the CDN in the same directory structure. The `<forge-icon>` component 
  uses these files with its `external` attribute to fetch the icons dynamically, and you can also choose to use the files much the same way to render them using any means
  you desire.

  There are typically two options when it comes to rendering SVG files directly in your application:

  * Referencing the files via the `src` attribute on a standard `<img>` element.
  * Fetching the SVG content as a string and rendering it directly in the HTML as an `<svg>` element.

  > The URL format for accessing the icons is as follows: `https://cdn.forge.tylertech.com/v1/icons/svg/<set>/<name>.svg` where
  > `<set>` is one of "standard", "extended", "custom" and `<name>` is the name of the icon.

## Icon sets

The Tyler icon library is comprised of multiple icon sets. Each set serves its own purpose and provides different icons to choose from. Below you will
find information about when to use each icon set, and where the icons are derived from.

> Please let us know if your team needs a specific icon and you are having trouble finding it, or you need a custom icon created!

### Standard

The standard icon set is an alias for the official Google Material icons. Refer to this set as often as possible for consistency across applications.

### Extended

The extended icons are an alias for the community-based Material icons. These are not endorsed by Google, but they offer many more icons to use
and follow the same standard design that the offical icons do. If you are unable to find an icon in the standard set, you'll most likely find
what you're looking for here.

### Custom

Icons within the custom set are created by Tyler on an as-needed basis when an icon from either of the two previous sets can't be used.

> **Note:** The SVG versions of the icons are the most up-to-date as they are compiled directly from their sources. The font-based icons are
> trimmed down to reduce their overall size to improve loading performance and are **deprecated**.
