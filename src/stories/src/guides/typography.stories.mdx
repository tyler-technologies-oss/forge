# Guide: Typography

Typography defines a set of consistent font styles use through your applications.

## Getting started

The first thing we will need to do is include the font file from the Forge CDN in your `<head>`:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.forge.tylertech.com/v1/css/tyler-font.css">
```

> This will load the Roboto font and weights that Forge requires from that font.

Forge also relies on a class to be set on a parent element (typically the `<body>` tag in most applications but can be any parent element) that all subsequent
elements/classes inherit base-level typography styles from:

```html
<body class="forge-typography">
```

To ensure you have this class loaded, make sure you either include the `forge.css` global stylesheet (includes theme, typography, component... etc. styles),
or at the very least the individual `forge-typography.css` file on its own.

```scss
@use '@tylertech/forge/dist/forge.css'; // Global StyleSheet

// OR

@use '@tylertech/forge/dist/typography/forge-typography.css'; // Individual typography StyleSheet
```

## CSS classes

Forge provides a set of predefined typography classes to make it easy for you to use consistent font styles across your app. See examples below. 

### Heading styles

These are the most common typography styles to use for common headings within your pages.

| Name                                     | Example
| :----------------------------------------| :----------------------
| `forge-typography--title`                | <span class="forge-typography--title">The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog</span>
| `forge-typography--headline5`            | <span class="forge-typography--headline5">The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog</span>
| `forge-typography--subtitle1`            | <span class="forge-typography--subtitle1">The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog</span>
| `forge-typography--subtitle1-secondary`  | <span class="forge-typography--subtitle1-secondary">The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog</span>
| `forge-typography--subtitle2`            | <span class="forge-typography--subtitle2">The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog</span>
| `forge-typography--subtitle2-secondary`  | <span class="forge-typography--subtitle2-secondary">The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog</span>
| `forge-typography--overline`             | <span class="forge-typography--overline">The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog</span>

### Body styles

Common font styles for standard body text, lists, and labels.

| Name                                     | Example
| :----------------------------------------| :----------------------
| `forge-typography--body1`                | <span class="forge-typography--body1">The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog</span>
| `forge-typography--body2`                | <span class="forge-typography--body2">The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog</span>
| `forge-typography--caption`              | <span class="forge-typography--caption">The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog</span>

### Additional styles

These are supplemental display styles that can be used for decorative purposes.

> Please make note that these do **not** necessarily map to `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`... etc. These are decorative classes that can be applied to any element.

| Name                                     | Example
| :----------------------------------------| :----------------------
| `forge-typography--headline1`            | <span class="forge-typography--headline1">The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog</span>
| `forge-typography--headline2`            | <span class="forge-typography--headline2">The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog</span>
| `forge-typography--headline3`            | <span class="forge-typography--headline3">The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog</span>
| `forge-typography--headline4`            | <span class="forge-typography--headline4">The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog</span>
| `forge-typography--headline6`            | <span class="forge-typography--headline6">The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog</span>
