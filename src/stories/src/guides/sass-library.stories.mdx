# Guide: Sass library

As you already know, Forge provides a vast library of Web Components. These components have built-in styles and functionality, and often times
it's useful to also reference those same styles in your libraries and applications to ensure that there is cohesion, and to reduce the need for
you to reinvent something that has already been built.

Forge exposes all of the internal Sass files as a library so that you can easily reference them. These files are separate out into Sass mixins
and variables that you can import and build from.

Along with component-specific styles, we also provide globally used Sass mixins/variables for things like typography, theme, layouts... etc. and
these can be useful to consume in your libraries and applications as well.

## Component-specific styles

Let's say you want to build a custom component similar to the Forge [Avatar](?path=/story/components-avatar--image). To reference the Sass library,
you would start by importing the mixins like so:

```scss
@use '@tylertech/forge/styles/avatar/mixins' as forge-avatar-mixins;
```

Now you can create your own classes that build on top of the mixins that separated out in a granular fashion:

```scss
.my-custom-avatar {
  @include forge-avatar-mixins.base;

  display: grid; // Override the default `flex` styling to `grid` for example if you'd like
}
```

We don't have documentation for the Sass files/mixins/variables that are available in the library, but if you're interested in this level of usage,
please feel free to browse the source code to what is available to you. It should be organized and named in a way that is clear to you, and the 
import syntax (with `@use` above) should show the correct path `@tylertech/forge/styles/*` to reference these files from the npm package.

## Global styles

Much like how you would import and use the component-specific styles, you will often find it useful to reference specific theme values or typography
styles within your applications to ensure a cohesive look-and-feel with Forge. This is especially useful when working with a dark theme so that your
application will automatically update when a dark theme is applied, much like the Forge component library does.

Now let's say we want to create a custom `<div>` in our app that uses the same typography and theme as Forge:

```html
<div class="my-custom-container">
  <h2 class="my-custom-header-typography">Header text</h2>
  <p class="my-custom-body-text">My custom body text</p>
</div>
```

The import syntax and usage is much the same as the component-specific approach noted above:

```scss expanded
@use '@tylertech/forge/styles/theme' as forge-theme;
@use '@tylertech/forge/styles/typography' as forge-typography;

.my-custom {
  &-container {
    @include forge-theme.property(background-color, surface); // Use the default "surface" theme for compatibility with dark mode!
  }

  &-header-typography {
    @include forge-typography.typography(title);

    font-size: 72px; // override the default font-size if you need
  }

  &-body-text {
    @include forge-typography.typography(body1);

    font-size: 32px; // override the default font-size if you need
  }
}

```

Using Forge as a Sass library within your applications is very important to avoid you having to reinvent the wheel, but it also allows for you to easily
inherit existing styles that are defined by Forge and get you back to focusing on building your application without worrying about the design details.

Please let us know if you run into any issues with any of this and we're always glad to help!
