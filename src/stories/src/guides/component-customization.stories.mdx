# Guide: Component customization

There are many ways that Forge components can be customized. Whether you are looking for theming, overriding internal styles
within the Shadow DOM, or looking to extend a component with new functionality you will find information about how to go
about that within this guide.

Certain aspects of this level of customization may require you to use Forge as a library itself to base your own component
library from, and others will be supported natively within the library to allow for customization within your application.

> Before reading this guide, it may be worthwhile to familiarize yourself with the [component architecture](?path=/story/guides-component-architecture--page).

## Theming

All components within Forge support theming at the core. To view detailed information about theming, please view the [theming guide](?path=/story/guides-theming--page).

## Structural customization

Forge is a Web Component-based project, and therfore provides HTML slots and CSS hooks for customizing how components are rendered.

### CSS

When attempting to customize a component via CSS, you will be using either [CSS Custom Properties][mdn-css-vars] or [CSS Shadow Parts][mdn-css-shadow-parts].
Both of these CSS-based solutions will give you access to changing how the internals of a component are rendered without adjusting any functionality. This
is the preferred approach for customization at the time of writing because it is the least intrusive and the least likely to cause adverse side effects.

For example, Forge provides many CSS custom properties from within specific components to help declaritively adjust certain internal styles:

```scss
forge-text-field {
  --forge-text-field-height: 100px;
}
```

If you want to have complete control over any of the internal styles within a component, that's where CSS Shadow Parts come in. This feature allows you to target
any named "part" of a component (any element within the components' Shadow DOM that has a `part` attribute applied) and set any CSS styles on it that you wish:

```scss
forge-text-field::part(root) {
  height: 100px;
  background-color: red;
  display: grid;
}
```

### HTML

You can also customize components via HTML using the provided HTML [slot][mdn-slots] elements within the Shadow DOM of a component. This allows for you to project
your own content into specifically named locations within the internal template of a component. Typically a component will expect certain elements to be applied
within these slots, but this also allows for you to potentially customize the usage to your needs if you see fit.

```html
<forge-text-field>
  <label for="input">Label</label>
  <input type="text" id="input" />

  <!-- Render a custom element into a slot if desired -->
  <forge-badge slot="helper-text">Custom helper text</forge-badge>
</forge-text-field>
```

So as you can see, you can customize anything you want. Now, would you typically want to do that? Probably not since it doesn't follow proper design guidance, but
these examples show you how you might be able to customize things and how easy that can be achieved.

## Functional customization

Forge does not provide a well defined extension API or plugin system at this time. It is definitely something that is on our roadmap to improve the
library as a whole in the future though.

That doesn't mean you can't start hacking away now though! As seen in the [component architecture][forge-component-arch] docs, the component library
is separated into many different classes that are inteneded to allow for downstream consumers to build on top of. The component classes we provide
for [custom elements](mdn-custom-elements) currently already consume the foundation and adapter classes. This is a great example of how you could
provide your own custom element classes that utilize and extend the existing foundation and adapter classes to override and provide your own
custom functionality!

### Extending components

When extending a component, it's expected that you provide a component class with your own public API instead of extending ours. From there you can
instantiate an instance of a custom foundation and custom adapter to take over the logic. This would also allow you to potentially even write
framework-specific components that reuse/override the existing foundation logic by providing a custom framework-specific component wrapper and a custom
adapter class that knows how to interact with the framework itself to read/write from/to the DOM.

Below is an example of how you might provide your own custom element class:

```typescript expanded
class MyCustomForgeComponent extends HTMLElement {
  private _foundation: MyCustomForgeComponentFoundation;

  constructor() {
    this._foundation = new MyCustomForgeComponentFoundation(new MyCustomForgeComponentAdapter(this));
  }

  public get size(): number {
    return this._foundation.size;
  }
  public set size(value: number) {
    this._foundation.size = value;
  }
}
```

Now you can define a foundation that potentially extends an existing Forge foundation:

```typescript expanded
class MyCustomAvatarFoundation extends AvatarFoundation {
  private _size: number;

  constructor(private _adapter: MyCustomAvatarAdapter) {
    super(_adapter);
  }

  public get size(): number {
    return this._size;
  }
  public set size(value: number) {
    if (this._size !== value) {
      this._size = value;
      this._adapter.setSize(this._size);
    }
  }
}
```

> As you can see, we extended the Forge `AvatarFoundation` keep all of the existing functionality, but we added a new `size` property.

and finally a custom adapter class:

```typescript expanded
class MyCustomAvatarFoundation extends AvatarAdapter {
  constructor(private _element: MyCustomAvatar) {
    super(_element);
  }

  public setSize(value: number): void {
    // Update the "size" within the DOM template...
  }
}
```

Currently we feel that this pattern is great for adding new functionality, but when it comes modifying existing functionality, we think we can improve
this pattern by structuring our code differently and by providing a utility API to make this easier and more straighforward. We will be introducing this
in the future.
