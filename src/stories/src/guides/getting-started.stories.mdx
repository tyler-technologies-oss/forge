# Guide: Getting Started

Welcome to the Forge getting started guide. This is where you will learn about how to install Forge and configure your application to use it.

As you've already learned, Forge uses [Web Components][WC]. This allows us to create encapsulated and reusable UI components that work with 
any framework, or no framework at all as the components are just HTML elements ([custom elements][CE] to be exact).

Please reach out to us on GitHub if you have any questions or concerns when getting up and running!

Let's get started.

## Installation

You have a couple ways to use Forge within your application. You can install it via npm, or use it via loading ES modules that are distributed via CDN.

### Versioning strategy

The Forge component library follows [semver](https://semver.org/) to ensure that consumers can rely on a standard versioning scheme when using Forge components.

### npm

To install the package through npm, you can simply run the following command:

```shell
npm install @tylertech/forge
```

You will then need to import and define the components you are using within your application:

```typescript expanded
import { defineButtonComponent, defineTextFieldComponent } from '@tylertech/forge';

// These functions should be called as early as possible when your application is bootstrapping
defineButtonComponent();
defineTextFieldComponent();
```

If you're prototyping, it can be handy to pull in all components:

```typescript
import { defineComponents } from '@tylertech/forge';

defineComponents();
```

> **Note:** make sure to call the definition functions as early as possible in your application bootstrapping process to ensure they are defined
> with the browser before your application is rendered to avoid [FOUC](https://webkit.org/blog/66/the-fouc-problem/).
>
> This only applies if you're not using lazy-loading/code splitting. Sometimes it can be handy to separate your application into well defined
> chunks of code that are loaded on demand. In these cases if you know you're only using a specific componet in these separate modules, make sure
> to import and define the component in the code for those modules to ensure the component is only bundled with that module.

If you're using a framework, we also maintain and distribute what we call "framework adapter" libraries that are not required to use Forge, but will
certainly make your life easier when using these frameworks and we definitely recommend checking them out!

- [Angular](https://github.com/tyler-technologies-oss/forge-angular)
- [React](https://github.com/tyler-technologies-oss/forge-react)
- Svelte (coming soon)

#### Package format

The `@tylertech/forge` package follows the following format:

- `dist/`: Contains all pre-built static distribution sources.
  - `<component name>/`: pre-built CSS stylesheets for specific components.
  - `esm/`: Contains the bundled ESM JavaScript sources (includes dependencies as code-split chunks)
  - `forge-core.css`: The optional Forge core stylesheet. Typically useful when using the `<forge-scaffold>` for your outer page layout.
  - `forge-dark.css`: The default Forge dark theme (must be loaded after `forge.css`).
  - `forge.css`: The pre-built Forge global stylesheet. Contains all required component-specific stylesheets. You should prefer to load individual stylesheets instead of this global stylesheet in production.
- `esm/`: Contains the unbundled ESM JavaScript sources as the main entry to the package (includes bare module specifiers)
- `styles/`: Contains all Sass stylesheets as a copy directly from the library.
- `LICENSE`: The Apache 2.0 license.
- `package.json`: The package specification.
- `README.md`: This README.md file.

### CDN

To use Forge via CDN as statically deployed ES module bundles and CSS stylesheets follow the guidance outlined below.

> The following information is related to consuming Forge from a public CDN such as [jsdelivr](JSDELIVR).

Reference the library, or a specific component via `<script type="module">` tags:

```html expanded
<!-- This will load the whole library of components (not ideal, but good for prototyping) -->
<script type="module" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tylertech/forge@2.0.0/dist/esm/index.js"></script>

<!-- This will load only individual components (recommended) -->
<script type="module" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tylertech/forge@2.0.0/dist/esm/button/index.js"></script>
<script type="module" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tylertech/forge@2.0.0/dist/esm/text-field/index.js"></script>
```

> **Note:** the custom elements in Forge are self-defining with the global custom element registry. If you want to disable that, you can set the following
> global flag **before** any Forge code runs: `window.__forgeFlags__autoDefine = false;`.

## StyleSheets

As you have seen in the previous section, there are global StyleSheets that are distributed with Forge. These StyleSheets provide
CSS custom properties for theming, default typography styles and classes, and classes to support Web Components that use light DOM.

We recommend that you only reference the styles your application needs. We also provide bundled StyleSheets that include everything
which can be nice for prototyping without having to worry about the details. See below for examples.

### npm

You can import the Forge stylesheets from the npm package as can be seen below:

```scss expanded
<!-- This StyleSheet provide some basic resets and setup for your application. It is optional. -->
@use '@tylertech/forge/forge-core.css';

<!-- The bare minimum StyleSheets for theming and typography. These are required. -->
@use '@tylertech/forge/theme/forge-theme.css';
@use '@tylertech/forge/typography/forge-typography.css';

<!-- A few components in the library use light DOM (their styles are not ecapsulated by the shadow DOM). You will need to reference these StyleSheets for these components to render properly. -->
@use '@tylertech/forge/button/forge-button.css';
@use '@tylertech/forge/icon-button/forge-icon-button.css';
@use '@tylertech/forge/table/forge-table.css';

<!-- Contains the full Forge StyleSheet which includes styles for all components in the library. -->
@use '@tylertech/forge/forge.css';
```

> **Note:** we always recommend that you include **only** the stylesheets that your application needs instead of referencing the full `forge.css` stylesheet. Below you will
> find an example of what the full global stylesheets brings in for you. Please copy into your app the lines that represent the stylesheets your app uses:
>
> ```sass expanded
> // Theme styles (required)
> @use '@tylertech/forge/dist/theme/forge-theme.css';
> 
> // Typography styles (required)
> @use '@tylertech/forge/dist/typography/forge-typography.css';
> 
> // Required global component styles (if applicable)
> @use '@tylertech/forge/dist/table/forge-table.css';
> ```

### CDN

If you are referencing the Forge component library from the Forge CDN, you can always reference the pre-built CSS stylesheets as seen below. Again, it's important to only 
reference the stylesheets your application is actually making use of.

```html expanded
<!-- This StyleSheet provide some basic resets and setup for your application. It is optional. -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tylertech/forge@2.0.0/dist/forge-core.css">

<!-- The bare minimum StyleSheets for theming and typography. -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tylertech/forge@2.0.0/dist/theme/forge-theme.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tylertech/forge@2.0.0/dist/typography/forge-typography.css">

<!-- A few components in the library use light DOM (their styles are not ecapsulated by the shadow DOM). You will need to reference these StyleSheets for these components to render properly. -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tylertech/forge@2.0.0/dist/button/forge-button.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tylertech/forge@2.0.0/dist/icon-button/forge-icon-button.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tylertech/forge@2.0.0/dist/table/forge-table.css">

<!-- Contains the full Forge StyleSheet which includes styles for all components in the library. -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tylertech/forge@2.0.0/dist/forge.css">
```

> **Important:** be sure to add the `forge-typography` class to your `<body>` element (or the root element where you want Forge typography to inherit from) otherwise your typography
> will not inherit properly in most cases.

## Font

Forge provides fonts that are distributed via a global CDN. You can easily add the proper fonts by including the stylesheet below.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.forge.tylertech.com/v1/css/tyler-font.css">
```
