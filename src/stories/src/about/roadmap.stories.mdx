# Roadmap

> **Important:** The Forge components library was previously built to solve the specific needs of Tyler Technologies products. As we look forward
> to the future and contributing the library to the open source community, we understand that the strict nature of various patterns and designs
> within the library may not fit the needs of external developers perfectly at the moment.
>
> The following roadmap details are intended to address these concerns and make the library design system agnostic, as well as adjusting usage patterns
> to make the components more intuitive and consistent as a whole. We're very excited about these changes, and we hope you are too!

As we look to the future toward improving the Forge library of Web Components, we have some specific goals that we would like to accomplish.

Our goal at a high level with the Forge 3.0 release is to focus on developer experience, performance improvements, accessibility improvements,
and adjustments to our architecture and patterns to allow for Forge to be more customizable and flexible whether that be through functional
or stylistic customization.

> At the time of writing, our current latest major version is `2.x`. Our plans for the next version are outlined below, with links to discussions
> within the GitHub repository for specific well-defined features/goals.

## Goals

### Improve developer experience

This goal will focus on our usage patterns from a consumers perspective. We have learned a lot over the lifetime of Forge, and we know there are
some better, more modern ways to solve certain problems. This release will focus heavily on our usage patterns around custom HTML content, better
seamless framework support, and adjustments to our component APIs for consistency and clarity.

### Performance improvements

We understand that there is a minimum overhead threshold that comes with using Web Components, specifically custom elements with Shadow DOM and
heavily initialization logic. Currently there are performance bottlenecks around our ripple functionality, render-blocking initialization logic,
and too many forced reflows that cause problems when many Forge elements are in the DOM. We intend to focus on each component to ensure we are
doing everything we can to get the best performance, as well as taking a step back to look at patterns like our ripple and improve upon that as
well.

### Accessibility improvements

Forge components will often times take care of most, if not all, accessibility concerns for you. In cases where this is not true, or if you need
to alter the accessibility of elements within the Shadow DOM, we intend to introduce new patterns and APIs to make this more convenient and
intuitive for developers. We will also be looking to audit each component for accessibility compliance again and make sure there have been no
regressions or missing items.

We also intend to improve our accessibility docs within this site for each component to help ensure developers are made aware of not only what
the components handle for you in regards to accessibility, but what you may need to on top of that to introduce your accessibility customizations.

### Style abstraction library

We intend to separate the Forge library of Web Components from the CSS styles. This will allow for us to create a new library that focuses on 
styles and interactions from a design perspective only. This library can then be consumed back into Forge to support the components.

This abstraction has many benefits, but the following are the most important to us:

- More control over introduction of shared libraries and naming conventions from those libraries. This allows Forge to hide its dependencies more easily.
- Allows for Forge design to be used outside of a Web Component context, and within other component libraries.
- Separates styles from implementation.
- Reduces complexity of our Sass library within Forge by deferring to a library of pre-defined and exposed mixins, variables, functions... etc.

> Along with this work we intend to refactor any components that currently rely on light DOM to use shadow DOM instead. We had reasons for using 
> light DOM for certain components originally, but our stance has changed on this over the years to favor encapsulation vs. exposing native elements.

### Architecture, patterns, and APIs

One of our long term goals for Forge components is to review our architecture patterns and APIs. We would like Forge components to be more extensible
and support a plugin system, as well as support global configuration flags. This would be make overriding default built-in functionality more feasible
for our consumers, as well as allow for introducing new functionality via plugins. We understand this can open us up to concerns about maintenance in
the future, but it's something we'd like to at least partially support depending on where we choose to use it.

## Proposals

See our [proposals discussion](https://github.com/tyler-technologies-oss/forge/discussions/61) in GitHub for more information about specific details
regarding features and plans for our next release.

We do not currently have a release date for 3.0 scheduled quite yet, but we will provide status updates on that as we begin work.
