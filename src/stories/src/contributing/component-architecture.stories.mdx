# Component architecture

The Forge components project contains native, standards-compliant Web Components. These Web Components must work properly across all major
browsers, provide unit tests, and must follow the proper architecture.

This library strictly follows the component/foundation/adapter pattern to separate the responsibilities/concerns of a component. This separation
provides a lot of benefits, but does add a layer of complexity.

A Custom Element is built within one class, the component class, which extends `HTMLElement` (through a `BaseComponent` class in Forge). This class
can quickly become hard to maintain and test for even a simple component if all of the DOM manipulation and state management is housed there. We
have found that by separating out the various responsibilities, the components are a lot easier to create, maintain, and reason about.

When creating a new Forge component, three classes are typically provided (depending on complexity):

- **Component**
  - This is the class that is used to instantiate the custom element, defines observed attributes, creates the default view, and instantiates the foundation class.
  - This class defers all of its functionality to an instance of its foundation class.
- **Foundation**
  - Holds the state, orchestrates and handles DOM listeners, communicates with the DOM through the provided adapter class.
  - This class does not touch the DOM. All DOM operations are deferred to the adapter class that was provided to it.
- **Adapter**
  - This class acts as the DOM adapter. All DOM operations must be made through this class.
  - The adapter knows how to interact with the view whether it be light or shadow DOM.
  - Typically, references to elements that are used a lot are kept within this class for the life of the adapter.

> The foundation and adapter classes are optional if a component does not have state or communicate with the DOM. An example of this would be a component that
> contains its own immutable state within its template, such as text that never changes and is always displayed the same way.

By structuring a Web Component this way, any part of the component can be swapped out and/or reused. This separation of concerns allows for easier unit testing and
keeps each class lean.

We will always prefer **standards-compliant vanilla JavaScript/TypeScript** over using frameworks, and other third-party dependencies to ensure we future-proof ourselves
as much as we can, and to avoid locking ourselves down to a specific technology or pattern.
