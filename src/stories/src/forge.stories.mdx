# Forge Components

Forge is a framework-agnostic library of Web Components adhering to the [W3C Web Component Spec][2] and the [Forge Design System][1]. Originally derived from Google's
[Material Components Web][3] project (MDC), this project aims to create a consistent UI/UX across applications regardless of choice in front-end frameworks. Theming is a
core part of the library such that competing design objectives can be achieved while still providing UI/UX cohesion across product catalogs.

To view more information, see the "Guides" section in the menu and to view component demos and documentation view the "Components" section.

## Getting started

When starting out using Forge, there are a few things you should be aware of to get the most out of it. Forge provides everything from typography and theme styles,
to fully featured UI components that make building an application a breeze.

Our goal is to let you focus on building functionality into your application while we take care of the design details. This should allow you to get to market more quickly,
and spend less time messing around with CSS and creating a reusable design system.

Please take a look at the following guides to get up and running with using Forge:
