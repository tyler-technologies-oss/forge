# Layering Tokens

Layering tokens define the order in which elements are stacked on top of each other.

This is implemented using the `z-index` CSS property.

It's important to note that these values are not fixed and can be adjusted as needed. If you need to integrate Forge with a
another library that uses different z-index values, you can override these tokens to match the other library's values, and
Forge will automatically adjust to use the new values across all components.

| Token                          | Value |
| ------------------------------ | ----- |
| `--forge-z-index-surface`      | `1`   |
| `--forge-z-index-header`       | `4`   |
| `--forge-z-index-backdrop`     | `7`   |
| `--forge-z-index-dialog`       | `8`   |
| `--forge-z-index-notification` | `9`   |
| `--forge-z-index-popup`        | `10`  |
| `--forge-z-index-tooltip`      | `11`  |
