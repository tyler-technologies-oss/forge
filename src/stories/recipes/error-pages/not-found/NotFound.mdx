# Recipe: Not found (404)

Examples where this could apply:

- Any time a page is missing
- Any time a specific resource could not be found which prevents the page from functioning

> **Note:** Most web servers allow you to set a 404 page by providing a URL in the web server configuration. If you create a specific page to host this
> component, you can configure server to use that page to cover any requests which result in a 404 error.
