The page-state component is a layout component that ensures consistent spacing, alignment, and structure for pages or containers that need to display a state such as empty,
error, 404... etc.

These states will typically be the only content on the page or container, and they provide a clear description, with optional actions to take when the user reaches the state.

> This component uses `@container` queries to adapt to the width of its parent container.

## Accessibility

- If the graphic is important to the communication of the page state, ensure it has an `alt` attribute which describes the graphic, otherwise include an `alt` attribute with an empty value (`alt=""`)
- If any action buttons are included, verify that they have a [role](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques) attribute set.
