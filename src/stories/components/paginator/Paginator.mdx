<Meta of={PaginatorStories} />

<Title />

The paginator component is used to navigate through a collection of items.

While this component is typically composed with a [list](?path=/docs/components-list--docs) or [table](?path=/docs/components-table--docs) component to
allow users to navigate large sets of data, it can be used in any context where pagination of content is desired.

## Alternative

The paginator also supports an alternative variant that is less verbose and more compact. This variant removes the page size selector, and uses a simpler
label for the page count. Use when space is limited, or if you don't want the user to be able to change the page size.
