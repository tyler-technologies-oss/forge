The Forge Label component is used to associate a text label with a compatible Forge component. This component can be used in place of the
standard HTML `<label>` element to provide an accessible label, as well as the correct typography.

The `<forge-label>` element can **only** be associated with specific Forge elements. The following elements are considered label aware:

<ul style={{ marginBottom: '48px' }}>
  {LABEL_CONSTANTS.labelableChildSelectors.map(name => (
    <li key={name}>
      <code>&lt;{name}&gt;</code>
    </li>
  ))}
</ul>

## Examples

### ID Associated

You can explicitly associate the label with an element by providing the `for` attribute with the `id` of the associated element.

<Canvas of={LabelStories.IDAssociated} />

### Nested

You can nest the associated element within the label component for implicit association.

<Canvas of={LabelStories.Nested} />

### Legend

You can also use the label component as a legend for a radio group.

<Canvas of={LabelStories.Legend} />

### Aligned List

Aligning labels with their associated element in a list format is a common UI pattern.

<Canvas of={LabelStories.AlignedList} />

### With Icon Button

You can also label icon buttons, and provide some custom styling to create a common design pattern.

<Canvas of={LabelStories.WithIconButton} />
