<Title />

Steppers display progress through a sequence by breaking it up into multiple logical and numbered steps. They may also be used for navigation.

## Linear vs Non-linear

Steppers are either linear or non-linear. This means that for linear steps the user needs to complete one step in order to move on to the next one. Non-linear steps
allow for a more flexible way of navigation by allowing the user to jump to any step at any time.

## Vertical

Vertical steppers are designed for narrow layouts. They are ideal for mobile devices or drawers adjacent to the content they relate to.
