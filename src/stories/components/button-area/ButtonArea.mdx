## Accessibility

- Always include a slotted `<button>` element.
- Add a concise, descriptive description of the button area's action as the text content of the slotted button.
    - The button's text content should preferably be the same as the visible text within the button area to reduce confusion. This can a portion of the content if long.
- Set any accessible attributes on the slotted button.
    - Set `aria-controls` if the button controls another element on the page.
    - Set `aria-expanded` to reflect the state of the controlled element if appropriate.
- Verify that you can reach every nested button by keyboard navigation.
    - Ensure that there is a visual cue that the nested button is currently in focus.
- Verify that pressing the space bar or enter key while focused on a button will activate the button area in the same manner as if it had been clicked with a mouse.
- Verify that there is sufficient contrast between the foreground text and background to meet WCAG requirements.
