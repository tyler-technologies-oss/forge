Checkboxes are used when a user can select one or more options from a list. They are commonly used in forms and settings pages, but can be used in many other contexts
to allow users to toggle between a checked and unchecked state.

Checkboxes can also have an indeterminate state, which is useful when the state of the checkbox is dependent on the state of its children or is not yet known.

## Accessibility

<A11yInformation>
Always provide a label for your checkbox to ensure that it is accessible to all users. Any text
provided in the default slot functions as a label, but an HTML `<label>` element, `<forge-label>`
component, `aria-label`, or `aria-labelledby` attribute can also be used for this purpose. Of these
alternatives, `<label>` and `<forge-label>` are preferred because they also extend the clickable
area of your checkbox. Use visible labels instead of the ARIA attributes whenever possible.

If your checkbox is part of a group, you can use an HTML `<fieldset>` element component to group the
checkboxes together and provide a legend for the group. This will help users understand the
relationship between the checkboxes and the group they belong to.

## CSS-Only

The checkbox component is also available as a CSS-only component without the need for JavaScript.
