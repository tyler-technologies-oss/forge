Checkboxes are used when a user can select one or more options from a list. They are commonly used in forms and settings pages, but can be used in many other contexts
to allow users to toggle between a checked and unchecked state.

Checkboxes can also have an indeterminate state, which is useful when the state of the checkbox is dependent on the state of its children or is not yet known.

- Verify that you can tab to each checkbox.
  - Ensure there is a distinct visual cue that a checkbox is checked or unchecked.
  - Ensure that there is a distinct visual cue that a checkbox is focused.
  - Ensure that there is a distinct visual cue when a checkbox is disabled.
- Verify that pressing the space bar key, while focused on a checkbox, will toggle it checked and unchecked in the same manner as it would be with a mouse click.
