<Title />

Chips allow users to enter information, make selections, filter content, or trigger actions. Chips should appear dynamically
as a group of multiple interactive elements, unlike buttons, which should be a consistent and familiar call to action.

## Anchor

Chips can be used as an anchor by providing the `href` attribute. This will render the chip as an anchor tag.

## Avatar

Chips also work well with avatars. You can add an avatar to the left or right of the chip with the [&lt;forge-avatar&gt;](?path=/docs/components-avatar--docs) component.

## Accessibility

- Verify that you can tab to each chip component.
  - Ensure that there is a visual cue that the chip component is active or inactive, and/or currently focused.
- Verify that pressing the space bar or enter key while focusing on a chip will toggle it in the same manner as if it had been clicked by a mouse.
- If a chip has a delete icon, ensure it can be focused and activated independently of the chip itself.
- Be sure to include a role attribute to indicate to screen readers what the chip is being used for.
- Verify that there is sufficient contrast between the foreground text and background to meet WCAG requirements.
- If color conveys important information, provide additional cues for users with color perception deficiencies.

## CSS-Only

Chips are also available as CSS-only components without the need for JavaScript.
