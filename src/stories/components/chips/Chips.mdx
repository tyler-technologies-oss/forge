<Title />

Chips allow users to enter information, make selections, filter content, or trigger actions. Chips should appear dynamically
as a group of multiple interactive elements, unlike buttons, which should be a consistent and familiar call to action.

## Anchor

Chips can be used as an anchor by providing the `href` attribute. This will render the chip as an anchor tag.

## Avatar

Chips also work well with avatars. You can add an avatar to the left or right of the chip with the [&lt;forge-avatar&gt;](?path=/docs/components-avatar--docs) component.
