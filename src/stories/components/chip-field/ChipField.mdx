Chip fields are a specialized variant of text field that allows users to input multiple values in a single field and represent them as chips.

<Canvas of={ChipFieldStories.Demo} />

## Deprecation Notice

The `<forge-chip-field>` component is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Existing components such as `<forge-text-field>` and
`<forge-select>` will be able to be used to create similar functionality which removes the current need for this specialized component.

## With Autocomplete

It is common to use an autocomplete component with a chip field to provide suggestions to the user as they type.

## Accessibility

- Add an `id` to your `<input>` element and bind it to your `<label>` element using the for attribute on the `<label>`.
- Ensure that the chips that are added to the field have descriptive `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` attributes.
- Make sure that the member chips that are added can be accessed via the keyboard left and right arrows.
  - There should be a distinct visual cue that indicates which chip is focused
- Similarly, make sure that when a chip is focused using the arrow keys, that the backspace and delete keys do remove them.
- Ensure that when disabled, the entire field as well as the member chips all appear visually and interactively disabled.
