The stack is a utility component that helps manage spacing and alignment of immediate children along a vertical or horizontal axis.

## Disclaimer

The stack component is a layout utility component that essentially abstracts the `flex` property of CSS. It is not a replacement for CSS Flexbox or Grid.
It is a simple utility component that helps manage spacing and alignment of immediate children along a vertical or horizontal axis.

It is very easy to overuse the stack component and end up with a lot of nested stacks. This can lead to performance issues and can make the codebase harder to maintain.

Make sure to use the stack component judiciously and only when necessary, and instead rely on CSS Flexbox and Grid for more complex layouts.

## Simple Vertical Form

You can use the stack to create a simple vertical form layout with even spacing between fields.

## Complex Form

You can also use the stack to create a more complex form layout with different spacing between fields, or multiple columns by nesting stacks.
