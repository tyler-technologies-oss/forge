Dialogs are used to display content in a layer above the rest of the page. They are typically used for
confirmations, alerts, or to display additional information. Dialogs can be modal or non-modal.

> The `<forge-dialog>` uses the native `<dialog>` element under the hood, which is now supported in all modern browsers.

## Usage

When creating a dialog it is important to consider the following:

- **Content**: The content of the dialog should be clear and concise. Use semantic elements to structure the content.
- **Actions**: Provide clear actions for the user to take. Use buttons to provide actions such as "Cancel" or "Save".
- **Accessibility**: Ensure that the dialog is accessible to all users. Use the `aria-labelledby` and `aria-describedby` attributes to provide context to screen readers.

The `<forge-dialog>` will size itself based on the content that it contains. You should always use a single root element within the dialog to ensure proper sizing. It is
common to compose the `<forge-dialog>` together with the `<forge-scaffold>` to provide a consistent layout.

```html
<forge-dialog aria-labelledby="dialog-title" aria-describedby="dialog-description">
  <forge-scaffold>
    <forge-toolbar slot="header">
      <h2 slot="start id="dialog-title">Dialog Title</h2>
    </forge-toolbar>
    <p id="dialog-description">Dialog Description</p>
    <forge-toolbar slot="footer">
      <forge-button slot="end">Close</forge-button>
    </forge-toolbar>
  </forge-scaffold>
</forge-dialog>
```

To ensure that your scaffold can flex with the dialog surface on smaller screens, make sure to apply the `height: auto` style to the `<forge-scaffold>` element. This
is because the scaffold uses a `height: 100%` by default which can cause the dialog to overflow on smaller screens.

Additionally, you can set a `width` or `min-width` on the `<forge-scaffold>` element to ensure that the dialog is not too narrow and/or wide in various screens sizes.

```css
forge-scaffold {
  height: auto;
  width: 100%;
  min-width: 500px;
}
```

### Focus Trap

The `<forge-dialog>` uses the native [&lt;dialog&gt;](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog) element under the hood, which
automatically traps focus within the dialog when it is open by making the rest of the page [inert](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/inert).
This means that users cannot interact with elements outside of the dialog content while it is open.

Previous implementations of Forge did not use the native `<dialog>` element, and adding focus traps required additional JavaScript to implement. This is no longer the case,
and you should be able to safely remove any focus trap logic or libraries now!

> **Note**: the focus is not "cycled" within the dialog content. The user can tab out of it to the browser itself. This is expected and it's an important accessibility feature.

### Modes

Dialogs modes are used to determine how the dialog is displayed on the page. The following modes are available:

- `modal`: Renders the modal in the [top layer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Top_layer) above all other content with a backdrop, and the rest of the page is [inert](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/inert).
- `nonmodal`: Renders the dialog in the normal flow of the page, but still above other content within its [containing block](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Containing_block).
- `inline-modal`: Renders the dialog in the normal flow of the page, but still above other content within its containing block, and with a backdrop. The rest of the page is **not** inert with this mode.

### Presets

The dialog component supports a number of presets to help you style your dialog. The following presets are available:

- `dialog`: The default dialog style centered in the viewport.
- `left-sheet`: A dialog that slides in from the left side of the viewport.
- `right-sheet`: A dialog that slides in from the right side of the viewport.
- `bottom-sheet`: A dialog that slides in from the bottom of the viewport.
- `top-sheet`: A dialog that slides in from the top of the viewport.

You can use the sidesheet presets in place of modal drawers or sidebars to display additional information or actions.

## Inline Usage

While dialogs are typically created dynamically and appended to the document, you can also use them inline in your HTML declaratively without any JavaScript via the `trigger` attribute:

```html
<button id="open-dialog">Open dialog</button>

<forge-dialog trigger="open-dialog" aria-labelledby="dialog-title" aria-describedby="dialog-description">
  <h2 id="dialog-title">Dialog Title</h2>
  <p id="dialog-description">Dialog Description</p>
</forge-dialog>
```

## Angular Adapter

In Angular it is common to show dialogs dynamically with Angular components rendered inside the dialog via services. The `@tylertech/forge-angular`
adapter library provides the `DialogService` to make this easy.

```typescript
import { Component, Inject } from '@angular/core';
import { DialogService } from '@tylertech/forge-angular';
import { DIALOG_DATA, DialogConfig, DialogRef } from '@tylertech/forge-angular';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-my-component',
  template: ` <button (click)="openDialog()">Open Dialog</button> `
})
export class MyComponent {
  constructor(private dialogService: DialogService) {}

  openDialog() {
    // Configuration to pass to the `<forge-dialog>` element
    const options: IDialogOptions = {
      preset: 'right-sheet',
      attributes: new Map([
        ['aria-labelledby', 'dialog-title'],
        ['aria-describedby', 'dialog-description']
      ])
    };

    // Data to inject into your Angular component via the `@Inject(DIALOG_DATA)` provider
    const data = {
      title: 'Dialog Title',
      description: 'Dialog Description'
    };

    // Show the dialog with your Angular component
    const dialogRef = this.dialogService.open(MyDialogComponent, { options, data });

    // Listen to dialog lifecycle events
    dialogRef.beforeClose.pipe(takeUntil(dialogRef.afterClosed)).subscribe(() => {
      console.log('Dialog closing');
    });

    dialogRef.afterClosed.subscribe(() => {
      console.log('Dialog closed');
    });
  }
}

export interface IConfirmDialogData {
  title: string;
  message: string;
}

@Component({
  selector: 'app-my-dialog',
  template: `
    <forge-dialog>
      <h2 id="dialog-title">{{ data.title }}</h2>
      <p id="dialog-description">{{ data.description }}</p>
      <button (click)="onClose()">Close</button>
    </forge-dialog>
  `
})
export class MyDialogComponent {
  constructor(
    @Inject(DIALOG_DATA) public data: IConfirmDialogData,
    private _dialogRef: DialogRef
  ) {}

  public onClose(): void {
    this._dialogRef.close();
  }
}
```

## Accessibility

- Ensure that keyboard navigation behaves properly and intuitively while the dialog is open.
  - In modal dialogs, keyboard navigation should be constrained only to within the modal dialog.
  - When the dialog is closed, return focus to a logical element on the page.
- Ensure that if there is a way to close the dialog via a mouse click, that there is also a way to close the dialog via keyboard.
- The dialog component will add the `role="dialog"` and `aria-modal="true"` attribute for you.
- Be sure to set the `aria-labelledby` and `aria-describedby` attributes on the `<forge-dialog>` element.
  - This will allow for a screen reader to properly announce the dialog title and description when it opens.
