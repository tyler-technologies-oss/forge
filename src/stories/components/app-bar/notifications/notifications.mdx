For convenience Forge provides the `<forge-app-bar-notification-button>` component. This component uses an icon-button with a predefined icon. The power of this component is that it will ensure a consistent experience for users across all applications that consume it.

If your application provides system notifications, use this component to show those notifications to the user.

> It is expected that you place this component in the `end` slot of the app-bar.

## Default

The notification button provides a consistent icon, as well as options to control an optional built-in badge.

<Canvas of={NotificationsStories.Demo} />

> In the future this component may have the ability to display notifications in a common format, but that functionality does not exist yet.

## API

<CustomArgTypes />

## Accessibility

- The component will handle adding necessary ARIA attributes for you, as well as ensure the proper color contrast ratio is used.
