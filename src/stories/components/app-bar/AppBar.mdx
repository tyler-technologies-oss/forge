<Title />

App bars are a common component used in web applications to provide a consistent location for branding, navigation, and other common elements.

The `<forge-app-bar>` is nothing more than a container for other add-on components, but it provides named slots and a common location for branding logo, title, and other actions.

## Default

A basic app bar just contains a title with no other elements.

<Canvas of={AppBarStories.Demo} />

## Full

The following example shows the usage of all of the common app bar elements placed in their corresponding slots.

<Canvas of={AppBarStories.Full} />

## API

<CustomArgTypes />

## Accessibility

- Ensure that the user can interact with each sub-component of the app bar using only the keyboard.
- The app bar component will use an `<h1>` for the title by default. If you override the title slot content, be sure to use the proper heading element.
  - Only **one** `<h1>` should be on a page at any given time (unless a new heading hierarchy is created as a sibling).
- A `<header>` element is built-in to the app bar component.
