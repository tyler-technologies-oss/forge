<Title />

App bars are a common component used in web applications to provide a consistent location for branding, navigation, and other common elements.

The `<forge-app-bar>` is nothing more than a container for other add-on components, but it provides named slots and a common location for branding logo, title, and other actions.

## Default

A basic app bar just contains a title with no other elements.

## Full

The following example shows the usage of all of the common app bar elements placed in their corresponding slots.

## Theming

> **Important:** The following information was introduced in version `3.8.0` and is not available in earlier versions.
>
> If you are seeing any problems with theming of sub-components, please ensure you are using the latest version of Forge, and then continue reading.

The app bar will automatically use the "brand" theme by default, and apply the appropriate colors to the background and text. This handles the most common use cases,
but you can also customize the app bar to use a different theme or color scheme. There are also additional utilities to help you theme the app bar and its sub-components.

The important aspect of theming the app bar is to correctly style the sub-components that are placed within it. By default the app bar will set the `color` style
that it expects, which will be inherited automatically to most text content. However, some elements may need to be explicitly set to the correct colors. For this reason,
we have provided a built in `theme="app-bar"` attribute that can be applied to common elements such as `<forge-icon-button>`, `<forge-button>`, and `<forge-tab-bar>`.

```html
<forge-app-bar>
  <!-- Themed icon button -->
  <forge-icon-button slot="end" theme="app-bar">
    <forge-icon name="settings"></forge-icon>
  </forge-icon-button>

  <!-- Themed button -->
  <forge-button slot="end" theme="app-bar">Profile</forge-button>

  <!-- Theme tab bar -->
  <forge-tab-bar slot="bottom" theme="app-bar">
    <forge-tab selected>Tab 1</forge-tab>
    <forge-tab>Tab 2</forge-tab>
    <forge-tab>Tab 3</forge-tab>
  </forge-tab-bar>
</forge-app-bar>
```

Using the `theme="app-bar"` attribute will automatically set the correct colors for usage within an app bar. Keep in mind that the following convenience components automatically set 
this attribute for you, so you do not need to set it manually:

- `<forge-app-bar-menu-button>`
- `<forge-app-bar-help-button>`
- `<forge-app-bar-profile-button>`
- `<forge-app-bar-notification-button>`

> **Note:** The `theme="app-bar"` attribute is only supported on a small subset of components.
>
> If you are using a component that does not support this attribute, you will need to manually use the app bar's theme tokens:
> ```css
> forge-app-bar forge-avatar {
>   --forge-avatar-background: var(--forge-app-bar-theme-foreground);
>   --forge-avatar-color: var(--forge-theme-text-high);
> }
> ```
>
> This will ensure that the component uses the correct colors for the app bar theme.
  

### White Theme

The app bar provides a built-in "white" theme that can be applied by setting the `theme="white"` attribute. This will change the background color to
white and the contrast/text color to black.

<Canvas of={AppBarStories.WhiteTheme} />

> **Note:** The sub-components will properly inherit the correct theme colors if using the `theme="app-bar"` attribute.

### Custom Theme

The app bar can also be themed using a custom theme by using the design tokens as CSS variables. This allows you to set the background color, text color, and other styles using to match your desired brand.

<Canvas of={AppBarStories.CustomTheme} />

> **Note:** To ensure that sub-components properly inherit your custom theme, you may either need to manually override their own component-specific design tokens, or
> you can update the app bar theme design tokens as well to ensure they are inherited by all sub-components that use the `theme="app-bar"` attribute.

## API

<CustomArgTypes />

## Accessibility

- Ensure that the user can interact with each sub-component of the app bar using only the keyboard.
- The app bar component will use an `<h1>` for the title by default. If you override the title slot content, be sure to use the proper heading element.
  - Only **one** `<h1>` should be on a page at any given time (unless a new heading hierarchy is created as a sibling).
- A `<header>` element is built-in to the app bar component.

## CSS-Only

The app-bar component is also available as a CSS-only component without the need for JavaScript.

<Canvas of={AppBarStories.CSSOnly} />

You may need to customize the layout and styles to fit your specific needs. While there are built-in "section" classes for you to use, these are very
specific to the default app bar layout and may not work for _all_ use cases. In these scenarios, you can always create your own layout within the app bar element,
and use your own HTML/CSS to style the content within while still using the standard app bar design for the overall container.

```html
<header class="forge-app-bar">
  <div class="my-custom-layout">
    <!-- Custom layout content -->
  </div>
</header>
```
