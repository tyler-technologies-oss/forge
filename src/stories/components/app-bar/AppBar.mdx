The app-bar should be used as the header for every page in your application to ensure consistency across our Tyler products and applications. It's the one constant across all applications that helps ensure our applications are perceived as being connected and familiar.

The app-bar itself is nothing more than a container for other add-on components, but it does provide named slots and a common location for branding logo and title.

## Default

A basic app-bar just contains a title with no other elements.

## Accessibility

- Ensure that the user can interact with each sub-component of the app bar using only the keyboard.
- The app bar component will use an `<h1>` for the title by default. If you override the title slot content, be sure to use the proper heading element.
  - Only **one** `<h1>` should be on a page at any given time (unless a new heading hierarchy is created as a sibling).
- A `<header>` element is built-in to the app bar component.
