<Title />
For convenience Forge provides the `<forge-app-bar-help-button>` component. This component uses an icon-button (with a predefined icon), and is wrapped in a Forge menu component. The power of this component is that it will ensure a consistent experience for users across all applications that consume it.

> It is expected that you place this component in the `end` slot of the app-bar.

## Default

The following example shows the help button being used in the Forge app-bar.

<Canvas of={HelpButtonStories.Demo} />

## API

## Accessibility

- The `<forge-app-bar-help-button>` component handles all accessibility attributes for you, but if you implement this yourself be sure to add the proper aria-label.
- Ensure that the proper color contrast ratio is met, especially if using a custom theme.
