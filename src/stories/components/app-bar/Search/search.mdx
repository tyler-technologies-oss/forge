<Title />

The app-bar search component is essentially just a strictly-styled `<input>` element that fits in with the app-bar ecosystem. It provides some additional functionality through its public API, but at the very least it gives a common component to use for a familiar search experience for users.

## Default

<Canvas of={SearchStories.Demo} />

## API

<CustomArgTypes />

## Accessibility

- Ensure that you provide a placeholder attribute for the `<input>` element to help give users an idea of what to enter.
- Ensure that you add an aria-label or aria-labelledby attribute to the `<input>`.
- If using a custom theme, make sure proper color contrast ratios are met and adjust using CSS custom properties if not.

## Types

```typescript
interface IAppBarSearchEventData {
  value: string;
  combined: boolean;
  context: string;
}
```
