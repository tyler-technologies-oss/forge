<Title />

For convenience Forge provides the `<forge-app-bar-menu-button>` component. This component uses an icon-button with a predefined icon. The power of this component is that it will ensure a consistent experience for users across all applications that consume it.

> It is expected that you place this component in the `start` slot of the app-bar.

## Default

<Canvas of={MenuButtonStories.Demo} />

> You will listen for click events on the `<forge-app-bar-menu-button>` element as if it were a native `<button>`. You can then react to that event to toggle the navigation drawer visibility.

## API

<CustomArgTypes />

## Accessibility

- The component will handle adding necessary ARIA attributes for you, as well as ensure the proper color contrast ratio is used.
