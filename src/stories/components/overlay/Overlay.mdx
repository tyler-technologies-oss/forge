Overlays are used to render content in above all other content on the page and positioned around a specified anchor element.

An overlay is a low-level building block component that does not provide any visual styles. Its only purpose is to render slotted
content above all other content on the page. The element is positioned around an anchor element with various positioning options.

The following components are examples of components that use a `<forge-overlay>` internally:

- [Tooltip](?path=/docs/components-tooltip--docs)
- [Popover](?path=/docs/components-popover--docs)
- [Toast](?path=/docs/components-toast--docs)

These components expose similar APIs that are passed down to the `<forge-overlay>` component.

<Canvas of={OverlayStories.Demo} />

## Context Menu

You can use an overlay to create a context menu that appears when the user right-clicks on the page.

<Canvas of={OverlayStories.ContextMenu} />

## API

<CustomArgTypes />

## Accessibility

Overlays do not provide any semantics by default. It is up to the developer to provide the necessary semantics for the content.
