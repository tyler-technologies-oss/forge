Selects are used to present a list of options to the user.

<Canvas of={SelectStories.Demo} />

## Label Position

The select supports a `labelPosition` property/attribute to control the position of the label. The default value is `"inset"`
where the label is positioned inside the select, but it can also be set to `"block-start"` or "inline-start" to position the
label above or to the left of the select respectively.

### Block Start

This variant positions the label above the select.

<Canvas of={SelectStories.LabelAbove} />

### Inline Start

This variant positions the label to the left of the select.

<Canvas of={SelectStories.LabelInline} />

> **Note:** The `labelPosition` property is available via [global configuration](?path=/docs/getting-started-global-configuration--docs) if
> you want to set adjust the default value for all select in your application.

## Multiple

The select supports a `multiple` property/attribute to allow multiple options to be selected.

<Canvas of={SelectStories.Multiple} />

When the select is in multiple mode, the `value` property/attribute should be an array of selected values.
