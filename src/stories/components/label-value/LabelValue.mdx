Label values are used to display data in a structured format. They are typically used to display key-value pairs, where the key is a label and the value is the data
associated with that label.

Label values are a simple layout component the provides consistency through structure, spacing, typography, and alignment. It is not intended to be used for
complex data structures, user interaction, or layouts, but rather for simply displaying readonly information.
