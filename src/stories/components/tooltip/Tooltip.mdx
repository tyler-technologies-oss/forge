<Title />

Tooltips display informative text when users hover over an element.

<Canvas of={TooltipStories.Demo} />

## Anchor

Tooltips are intended to be "anchored" to another element. This is typically done by setting the `anchor` property/attribute to the `id` of the element that the tooltip should be anchored to.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```html
<button id="button">Hover over me</button>
<forge-tooltip anchor="button">This is a tooltip</forge-tooltip>
```

## Type

You can set the `type` property/attribute to one of the following values to control its association to the anchor element.

- `presentation`: A tooltip that is purely presentational and has no accessible meaning to its anchor.
- `label`: The tooltip will be interpreted as the accessible label for the anchor element.
- `description`: The tooltip will be interpreted as the accessible description for the anchor element.

## Accessibility

- Verify that there is sufficient contrast between the foreground text and background to meet WCAG requirements.
- The target element receives the proper ARIA attributes such as `aria-labelledby` or `aria-describedby` where necessary.
- Should not contain interactive content.
