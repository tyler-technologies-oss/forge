<Title />

The date range picker is very similar to the usage of the standard datepicker component, the only difference is that it allows for the selection of two dates that define a start and end range. This means that when setting up the component, you must provide it two `<input>` elements, one for the start date and one for the end date.

There are many configuration options available through the component API, along with date masking options that force the dates to be entered using a specific format.

## Accessibility
When using a screen reader, ensure keyboard navigation in the calendar is announced.
Be sure that you add the proper `aria-label` to the `<input>` element if necessary.
The date picker component will add the following ARIA attributes to the `<input>` element for you:
- aria-live
- aria-atomic
- aria-haspopup
- aria-expanded
- aria-owns
- aria-disabled
