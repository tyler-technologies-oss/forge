Cards are used to group related content and actions together in a single container.

## Basic

<Canvas of={CardStories.Demo} />

> By default the card component will apply a `padding` of `16px` to the entire internal container element.
>
> Use the `--forge-card-padding` CSS custom property to set a custom padding value.

<Canvas of={CardStories.Styled} />

## API

<CustomArgTypes />

## Accessibility

- The card component should not interfere with tab flow.
- Add a `role` attribute if this card has any applicable role that should be known to screen readers.
- Consider using the `"group"` role on the `<forge-card>` element if the content is related and separate from other surrounding items.
