The card component is intended to be used as a layout design element to help group related content together into sections.

This a simple component that doesn't provide any functionality, but brings consistency through common default values for padding, box-shadow, outline, border and some structure within its template to help support fixed header and footer while allowing for a scrollable body. You are free to place any content you would like into this component using its default slot.

## Basic

<Canvas of={CardStories.Demo} />

>By default the card component will apply a `padding` of `16px` to the entire internal container element.
>
>Use the `--forge-card-padding` CSS custom property to set a custom padding value.
