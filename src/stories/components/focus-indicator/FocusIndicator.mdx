Focus indicators (also referred to as focus rings) are a visual indicator that highlights the element that currently has keyboard focus.
This is important for users who navigate the web using a keyboard or other assistive technology.

Focus indicators are building block components that are usually composed together within the internals of other components that allow
for interactivity, such as buttons, text fields, sliders... etc.
