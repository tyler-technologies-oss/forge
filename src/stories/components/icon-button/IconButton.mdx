## Accessibility

- Verify that you can reach every button by keyboard navigation.
  - Ensure that there is a visual cue that the button is currently in focus.
  - Ensure that there is an `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` attribute indicating the purpose of the button.
- Verify that pressing the space bar or enter key while focused on a button will activate the button in the same manner as if it had been clicked with a mouse.
- If color conveys important information, provide additional cues for users with color perception deficiencies.

## CSS-Only

The icon-button component is also available as a CSS-only component without the need for JavaScript.
