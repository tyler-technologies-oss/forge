<Title />

Icon buttons communicate actions that users can take.

## Variants

Icon buttons can be styled in different ways to indicate their purpose and emphasis level.

## Toggle

Icon buttons can be toggled on and off to indicate a state change.

When using a toggle icon button, ensure that you have provided an "off" icon in the default slot, and a "on" icon placed in the `on` slot.
The "on" icon should be visually distinct from the "off" icon to indicate the current state of the button. Typically an outlined-style icon
is used for the "off" state and a filled-style icon is used for the "on" state, but any icons can be used.

## Themed

## With Anchor

## With Badge

## With Circular Progress

It is common to place a circular progress indicator inside an icon button to indicate that an action is in progress.

## With Label

Icons buttons can be composed with the `<forge-label>` element to provide an accessible label for the button, as well as the correct label typography.

## Accessibility

- Verify that you can reach every button by keyboard navigation.
  - Ensure that there is a visual cue that the button is currently in focus.
  - Ensure that there is an `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` attribute indicating the purpose of the button.
- Verify that pressing the space bar or enter key while focused on a button will activate the button in the same manner as if it had been clicked with a mouse.
- If color conveys important information, provide additional cues for users with color perception deficiencies.

## CSS-Only

The icon-button component is also available as a CSS-only component without the need for JavaScript.
