<Title />

Inline messages are used to provide feedback to users about their actions or to display important information related to the page content.

<Canvas of={InlineMessageStories.Demo} />

## With Title

You can use the `title` slot to provide a title for the inline message.

<Canvas of={InlineMessageStories.WithTitle} />

## Themed

There are several built-in themes that can be used to style the inline message via the `theme` property/attribute. Themes should not be the _only_
indicator of the message's importance, it is recommended to also use an icon or other visual indicator to assist with users who may have difficulty
distinguishing between colors.

## Accessibility

- If the inline-message is used to display an important notification to a user, use the `role="alert"` attribute on the `<forge-inline-message>`element.
  - This is equivalent to using `aria-live="assertive"`.
  - If the message is less urgent, you can use `aria-live="polite"` to wait until the user is finished with their current task.
