The scaffold component is intended to be used as a layout tool. You can use it for your full application layout, or even nest scaffolds within other scaffolds. Think of this component as a structural tool (it uses CSS grid under the hood) with named locations that allow you render any element you want in those named locations.

>Note: The scaffold handles common page layouts, but it's simply a wrapper around native CSS `grid` styles to aid in common application layouts. We recommend that you become familiar with `flexbox` and `grid` for scenarios where you cannot use the scaffold. Suggested learning resources:

Using a scaffold will help you place elements in pre-defined locations within a layout. This makes it very easy to spin up common layouts without having to write any CSS at all. For instance, by placing content within the built-in slots the component will handle overflowing content for you.

>Note: It is recommended that you use a single container element for each slot within the scaffold. This is because the scaffold applies specific CSS grid styles to the slotted elements, and this can cause unwanted side-effects to your elements if you place things like multiple buttons directly into the root of the slots themselves.

>If you encounter rendering issues where content is stacked on the z-index, ensure that each named slot is used only once.

## API

## Accessibility
- Ensure that all of the content in each of the slots is accessible by tabbing with the keyboard.
- Use the proper semantic elements for content (if applicable) such as `<header>`, `<main>`, `<aside>`... etc..
  - The scaffold component itself has no semantic meaning.
  - The scaffold component does not make any assumptions about the content you provide so it's up to you to provide the proper landmark elements.
