<Title />

Modal drawers are used to display secondary content, such as navigation menus, and are typically used for mobile devices or smaller screens.

Modal drawers also have a backdrop that covers the entire screen when open, and can be dismissed by the user by clicking outside the drawer
on the backdrop.

**Important:** modal drawers are a being phased out in favor of dialogs with a `preset`. See the [dialog](?path=/docs/components-dialog--docs)
component for more information.

## Accessibility

The drawer component does **not** provide any semantics by default. Developers should provide their own `<aside>` for navigation,
or various ARIA roles in other scenarios.
