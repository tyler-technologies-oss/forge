<Meta of={DrawerStories} />

<Title />

Drawers are used to display content that is not a primary focus of the page. They can be used for navigation, settings, or other secondary content.

There are two types of drawers:

- **dismissible:** can be hidden by the user via a button provided by the developer
- **permanent:** always visible

<Canvas of={DrawerStories.Demo} />

## API

<CustomArgTypes />

## Accessibility

The drawer component does **not** provide any semantics by default. Developers should provide their own `<aside>` for navigation,
or various ARIA roles in other scenarios.
