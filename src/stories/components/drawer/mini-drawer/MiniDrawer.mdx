Mini drawers are used to display secondary content, and are typically used for navigation menu purposes.

There are two types of mini drawers:

- **dismissible:** can be hidden by the user via a button provided by the developer
- **permanent:** always visible

The mini drawer component is a variant of the standard [Drawer](?path=/docs/components-drawer--docs) component, but with a smaller width.

## Hover

The mini drawer can be configured to open to a larger width when hovered with a pointer. This is useful for desktop applications where the user has a mouse.

<Canvas of={MiniDrawerStories.Hover} />

> **Note:** The hover feature is not available on touch devices.

## API

## Accessibility

The drawer component does **not** provide any semantics by default. Developers should provide their own `<aside>` for navigation,
or various ARIA roles in other scenarios.
