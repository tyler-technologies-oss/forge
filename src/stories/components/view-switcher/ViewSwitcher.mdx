<Meta of={ViewSwitcherStories} />

<Title />

The view switcher component allows users to toggle between different views of content. This component is often used in conjunction with tabs to control which view actively displayed.

> **Note**: Content hidden by this component is still present in the DOM unless you control it manually.

<Canvas of={ViewSwitcherStories.Demo} />

## Animations

The view switcher can animate between views using the views via the `animationType` property/attribute. The following animations are available:

- `slide`: The new view slides in from the right while the old view slides out to the left.
- `fade`: The new view fades in while the old view fades out.
- `none`: The new view replaces the old view without any animation. This is the default.
