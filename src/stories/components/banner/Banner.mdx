<Meta of={BannerStories} />

<Title />

The banner component is intended to be used as a way to deliver a short but important message to the user. It has a high degree of emphasis and should not be used for general messaging. If you need to show less important messages, or messages scoped to a more specific section of your page, you should consider using the inline message component. instead.

This component supports built-in predefined themes. It can be configured to be either static or dismissable. It can contain a button to trigger whatever action you need.

## Default

<Canvas of={BannerStories.Default} />

## Themed

<Canvas of={BannerStories.Themed} />

## Combined

Here is an example usage combined with a forge-button component:

<Canvas of={BannerStories.Combined} />

<blockquote>
  <strong>Note</strong>: The design for the banner specifically requests that the button's background be white. Due to limitations in how deep a css selector can drill into a slotted element, you will need to add that background color yourself.
</blockquote>

## API

<CustomArgTypes />

## Accessibility
- If the banner is used to display an important notification to a user, use the `role="alert"` attribute on the `<forge-banner>` element.
  - This is equivalent to using `aria-live="assertive"`.
  - If the banner is less urgent, you can use `aria-live="polite"` to wait until the user is finished with their current task.
