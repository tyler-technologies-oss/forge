<Title />

Badges are used to highlight an item's status for quick recognition. They are non-interactive and are typically used to convey information such as a count, status, or category.

> If you need an interactive badge-like element, consider using [Chips](/?path=/docs/components-badge--docs).

## Accessibility

- Verify that there is sufficient contrast between the foreground text and background to meet WCAG 2.2 requirements.
- If color conveys important information, provide additional cues for users with color perception deficiencies such as an icon.

## CSS-Only

The badge component is also available as a CSS-only component without the need for JavaScript.
