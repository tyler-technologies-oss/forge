<Title />

Badges are used to highlight an item's status for quick recognition. They are non-interactive and are typically used to convey information such as a count, status, or category.

> If you need an interactive badge-like element, consider using [Chips](?path=/docs/components-chips--docs).

## Strong

Badges can be styled with a `strong` variant to emphasize their importance.

## With Icon

Badges can include an icon to provide additional context or visual interest. The icon can be placed in the `icon` slot and will be rendered before the badge text.

## Accessibility

- Verify that there is sufficient contrast between the foreground text and background to meet WCAG 2.2 requirements.
- If color conveys important information, provide additional cues for users with color perception deficiencies such as an icon.

## CSS-Only

The badge component is also available as a CSS-only component without the need for JavaScript.
