<Title />

Badges are used to highlight an item's status for quick recognition. They are non-interactive and are typically used to convey information such as a count, status, or category.

> If you need an interactive badge-like element, consider using [Chips](/?path=/docs/components-badge--docs).

## Themed

<Canvas of={BadgeStories.Themed} />

## Strong

Badges can be styled with a `strong` variant to emphasize their importance.

<Canvas of={BadgeStories.Strong} />

## With Icon Button

Badges are commonly composed together with the [icon button](/?path=/docs/components-icon-button--docs) component via the `badge` slot.

<Canvas of={BadgeStories.WithIconButton} />

## CSS-Only

The badge component is also available as a CSS-only component without the need for JavaScript.

<Canvas of={BadgeStories.CSSOnly} />

To use the CSS-only badge component, include the following CSS file in your project:

```scss
@use '@tylertech/forge/dist/badge/forge-badge.css';
```

> For more information on CSS-only components, see the [CSS-Only Components](?path=/docs/getting-started-css-only-components--docs) guide.

## Accessibility

- Verify that there is sufficient contrast between the foreground text and background to meet WCAG 2.2 requirements.
- If color conveys important information, provide additional cues for users with color perception deficiencies such as an icon.
