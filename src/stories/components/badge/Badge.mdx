<Meta of={BadgeStories} />

<Title />

The badge component is intended to be used as a static, non-interactive element on the page for displaying labels. If you need to make the element interactive you should consider using the chip component instead.

This component supports built-in predefined themes, as well as common positioning utilities when used with other components such as the icon button component.

## Default

<Canvas of={BadgeStories.Default} />

## Themed

<Canvas of={BadgeStories.Themed} />

## With Icon

You can compose Badges together with icons using the `<forge-button-icon>` component. The Badge will automatically
apply the proper dimensions to the icon.

<Canvas of={BadgeStories.WithIcon} />

## API

<ArgTypes exclude={['text']} />

## Accessibility
- If necessary, include a `role` attribute to indicate to screen readers what the badge is being used for.
- Verify that there is sufficient contrast between the foreground text and background to meet WCAG 2.1 requirements.
- If color conveys important information, provide additional cues for users with color perception deficiencies such as an icon.
