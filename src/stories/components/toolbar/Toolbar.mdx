<Title />

Toolbars are layout components that allow for placing content in named regions of its template.

This component is useful headers and footers within pages, dialogs, sections... etc. to ensure consistent spacing and positioning.

<Canvas of={ToolbarStories.Demo} />

> **Tip**: If you need the toolbar to expand vertically when its contents wrap, set: `--forge-toolbar-height: 'auto'` to disable the fixed height.

## Inverted

You can use the `inverted` attribute for footers to move the border to the top.
