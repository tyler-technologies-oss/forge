<Meta of={ToolbarStories} />

<Title />

The toolbar component allows you to place titles and actions within a container and align them to the `start`, `center`, or `end` of the toolbar.

This component is useful headers and footers within pages, dialogs, sections... etc. to ensure consistent spacing and positioning.

> **Note**: You can use the `inverted` attribute for footers to move the border to the top.

## Example

<Canvas of={ToolbarStories.Demo} />

## Inverted

<Canvas of={ToolbarStories.Inverted} />

## API

<CustomArgTypes />

> **Tip**: If you need the toolbar to expand vertically when its contents wrap, set: `--forge-toolbar-height: 'auto'` to disable the fixed height.

## Accessibility

- Ensure that all of the controls that are accessible by a mouse are also accessible by keyboard.
- Ensure the controls are reachable by the tab key.
- Ensure each control can be updated or activated by the keyboard.
