<Title />

The toolbar component allows you to place titles and actions within a container and align them to the `start`, `center`, or `end` of the toolbar.

This component is useful headers and footers within pages, dialogs, sections... etc. to ensure consistent spacing and positioning.

>**Note**: You can use the `inverted` attribute for footers to move the border to the top.

<Canvas of={ToolbarStories.Demo} />
