Lists are used to display a collection of items in a vertical format. They can be used for navigation, selection, or just to display static data.

Lists are semantically equivalent to the HTML `<ul>` and `<li>` elements, can be used in the same way, and are **static by default**. If you want your
list items to be interactive, see the examples below.

## Interactive

Lists can be made interactive by providing a `<button>` element around your main list item content. This allows the list item to receive focus, and provides
visual feedback when the item is hovered or pressed.

## With Anchor

Lists can also be used for navigation by providing a `<a>` element around your main list item content instead. When your list item will navigate to a new page,
it is recommended to use an `<a>` element to provide the correct semantics and expectations for users.

## Navigation Menu

It is common to provide a list of navigation items in a [drawer](?path=/docs/components-drawer--docs) or other container component. This gives your application
a consistent location for the central navigation of your site.

### Navlist

When lists are placed within a `<forge-drawer>` or are used for navigation menus, you should add the `navlist` attribute to your `<forge-list>` element so that the
list items are styled appropriately.

```html
<forge-list navlist></forge-list>
```

When using a list as a navigation menu, it is common to provide a visual indicator of the currently active item. This can be done by providing a `selected`
attribute to the list item that is currently active, or by using the `selectedValue` attribute on the `<forge-list>` element to indicate the currently active
item by its matching `value`.

Additionally, you should provide the `aria-current="page"` attribute to the currently active list item to indicate to screen readers that it is the current page.

## With Expandable Items

Lists can also contain expandable items via the [expansion panel](?path=/docs/components-expansion-panel--docs) component, which can be used to show or hide additional
content and/or sub-lists.

> **Important:** make note of the adjacent wrapper `<div>` elements that have a `role="listitem"` attribute to ensure that the structure is accessible to screen readers.

## Accessibility

- Verify that you can reach each active list item by keyboard navigation.
  - Ensure a distinct visual style is applied which highlights the currently focused list item.
- Verify that pressing the space bar or enter key while focused on a list-item will activate the list-item in the same manner as if it had been clicked with a mouse.
- Be sure to include a role attribute to indicate to screen readers what the list-item is being used for.
- If the list item contains a checkbox or radio box, ensure that it can be focused and selected/toggled by keyboard.
