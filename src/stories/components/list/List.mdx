## Accessibility

- Verify that you can reach each active list item by keyboard navigation.
  - Ensure a distinct visual style is applied which highlights the currently focused list item.
- Verify that pressing the space bar or enter key while focused on a list-item will activate the list-item in the same manner as if it had been clicked with a mouse.
- Be sure to include a role attribute to indicate to screen readers what the list-item is being used for.
- If the list item contains a checkbox or radio box, ensure that it can be focused and selected/toggled by keyboard.
