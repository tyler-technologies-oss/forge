<Title />

Linear progress indicators display progress by animating an indicator along a fixed path.

There are two types of linear progress indicators:

- **Determinate**: Indicates how long an operation will take when the percentage complete is known.
- **Indeterminate**: Indicates that an operation is ongoing with an unknown percentage complete. This is the default.

### Determinate

Determinate linear progress indicators fill from 0% to 100%, representing the percentage complete.

### Buffer

Buffer linear progress indicators are sub-variant of determinate indicators, and fill from 0% to 100% while a secondary indicator fills from 0% to 100% as well to represent the buffer.
