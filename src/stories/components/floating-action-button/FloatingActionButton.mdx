<Title />

Use floating action buttons to represent the primary action on a screen within an application. It's recommended to only use one floating action button per screen.

<Canvas of={FloatingActionButtonStories.Demo} />

## Positioning

Typically you will position floating action buttons manually on the screen, for example to apply a fixed position in the bottom-right you could use this CSS:

```css
.bottom-right {
  position: fixed;
  bottom: 16px;
  right: 16px;
}
```

## Extended

Extended floating action buttons are larger and have a text label.

## Accessibility

- Buttons containing only icons should be given a meaningful label via `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`.
- Avoid using capitalized text because screen readers will read the text character-by-character. Instead use `text-transform: uppercase`.
- Ensure the FAB can be reached by keyboard navigation.
- Ensure that there is a distinct visual cue when the FAB is in focus.
- Verify that there is sufficient contrast between the foreground text and background to meet WCAG requirements.
- Ensure that buttons placed above other content on the page have proper contrast ratio.
