Menus are used to provide a list of options/actions to a user, and are typically anchored dynamically to a button or other similar trigger element.

The `<forge-menu>` component is a decorator style component which means it wraps around a trigger element and will attach itself to automatically open
and close when the trigger element is interacted with.

Menus can be used in a variety of ways, such as a simple list of options, a list of actions, or a hierarchical/cascading list of options. Menus do not
hold selection state.

## Cascading

Cascading menus are used to display a hierarchical list of options. When a menu item is hovered, a child menu will open next of the parent menu item.

  - Ensure that there is a visual cue that the trigger element is currently in focus.
- Verify that pressing the space bar or enter key while focused on the trigger element will activate the menu in the same manner as if it had been clicked with a mouse.
- Ensure each menu item can be selected by using arrow-up and arrow-down.
