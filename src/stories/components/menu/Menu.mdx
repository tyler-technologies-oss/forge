Menus are used to provide a list of options/actions to a user, and are typically anchored dynamically to a button or other similar trigger element.

The `<forge-menu>` component is a "decorator" style component which means it wraps around a trigger element and will attach itself to automatically open
and close when the trigger element is interacted with.

Menus can be used in a variety of ways, such as a simple list of options, a list of actions, or a hierarchical/cascading list of options. Menus do not
hold selection state.

## JavaScript

The `<forge-menu>` currently requires the use of JavaScript to set the options to display in the menu dropdown. The `options` property is an array of objects
where each object represents a menu item, and each object can have various configuration supplied for things like the label, icon, custom templates, and more.

Below is an example of a basic array of menu options:

```javascript
const options: IMenuOption[] = [
  { label: 'Option 1', value: 'option-1' },
  { label: 'Option 2', value: 'option-2' },
  { label: 'Option 3', value: 'option-3' }
];
```

This options array can then be set (or bound via framework) to the `options` property of the `<forge-menu>` component.

> **Note:** If you need to render icons in the menu, you can use the `icon`/`leadingIcon` and/or `trailingIcon` properties on the menu option object.
> There are also corresponding `leadingIconType` and `trailingIconType` properties to specify the element type that will be rendered. Set these
> to `'component'` to render a `<forge-icon>` element.

## Cascading

Cascading menus are used to display a hierarchical list of options. When a menu item is hovered, a child menu will open next of the parent menu item.

## Accessibility

- Verify that the trigger element used to open and close the menu can be focused and activated by keyboard.
  - Ensure that there is a visual cue that the trigger element is currently in focus.
- Verify that pressing the space bar or enter key while focused on the trigger element will activate the menu in the same manner as if it had been clicked with a mouse.
- Ensure each menu item can be selected by using arrow-up and arrow-down.
