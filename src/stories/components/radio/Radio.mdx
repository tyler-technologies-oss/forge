<Title />

Radios are used when a user must select one option from a set of options. They are used when there are two or more options that are mutually exclusive and the user must select exactly one.

## Grouping

Radio buttons should be part of a radio group and interpreted as such by assistive technologies such as screen readers. By default, radios will form an implicit group
based on their `name` attribute. If you want to group radios explicitly you can either provide a `role="radiogroup"` attribute to an ancestor element, or use the
`<forge-radio-group>` element.

### Name

This example shows how radios are grouped implicitly by their `name` attribute.

```html
<forge-radio name="default">Option 1</forge-radio>
<forge-radio name="default">Option 2</forge-radio>
<forge-radio name="default">Option 3</forge-radio>
```

### Role

This example shows how radios are grouped explicitly by their `name` and the ancestor element's `role="radiogroup"` attribute to provide a label for the group.

```html
<div role="radiogroup" aria-label="Choose a radio option">
  <forge-radio name="default">Option 1</forge-radio>
  <forge-radio name="default">Option 2</forge-radio>
  <forge-radio name="default">Option 3</forge-radio>
</div>
```

### Radio Group

This example shows how radios are grouped explicitly by the `<forge-radio-group>` element.

```html
<forge-radio-group>
  <forge-label legend>Choose an option</forge-label>
  <forge-radio value="option1">Option 1</forge-radio>
  <forge-radio value="option2">Option 2</forge-radio>
  <forge-radio value="option3">Option 3</forge-radio>
</forge-radio-group>
```

> **Note:** Take note of the `<forge-label>` element with the `legend` attribute. This is used to provide an accessible label for the radio group.

## Accessibility

- Ensure that all of the controls that are accessible by a mouse are also accessible by keyboard.
  - Ensure the controls are reachable by the tab key.
  - Ensure each control can be updated or activated by the keyboard.
- Radio buttons should be part of a radio group and interpreted as such by assistive technologies such as screen readers.
  - Ensure that your radio group also has an `aria-label` attribute describing its purpose.
