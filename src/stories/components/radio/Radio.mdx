<Title />

The radio component acts like the native `<input type="radio">` element. It provides some minor functionality, but its primary purpose is to handle the styling of the element.

While this component can be used on its own, it's typically part of a radio group, and care should be taken to account for accessibility concerns when creating a radio group. See the Accessibility tab for more information.

## Accessibility
- Ensure that all of the controls that are accessible by a mouse are also accessible by keyboard.
  - Ensure the controls are reachable by the tab key.
  - Ensure each control can be updated or activated by the keyboard.
- Radio buttons should be part of a radio group and interpreted as such by assistive technologies such as screen readers.
  - Ensure that your radio group also has an `aria-label` attribute describing its purpose.
