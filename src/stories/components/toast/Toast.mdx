<Title />

Toasts are non-modal notifications that appear in response to user interactions. They can optionally provide a dismissible button, but automatically dismiss after a set duration.

<Canvas of={ToastStories.Demo} />

## Dismissible

Toasts can be dismissed by the user when setting `dismissible` to `true`.

<Canvas of={ToastStories.Dismissible} />

## Dynamic Usage

Toasts are typically created dynamically in response to user interactions. The following example demonstrates how to create a toast from JavaScript.

```javascript
ToastComponent.present({ message: 'Save successful' });
```

> Toasts will automatically dismiss after the `duration` elapses and remove themselves from the DOM.

## Declarative Usage

Toasts can also be used inline declaratively in your HTML and toggled via the `open` property/attribute.

```html
<forge-toast open>Save successful</forge-toast>
```

> Inline toasts do not automatically remove themselves from the DOM. You must toggle the `open` attribute to hide the toast.

## Angular Usage

The [Angular adapter](?path=/docs/frameworks-angular--docs) provides a `ToastService` that can be used to show toasts from your Angular components.

```typescript
import { ToastService } from '@tylertech/forge-angular';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-my-component',
  template: `<button (click)="showToast()">Show Toast</button>`
})
export class MyComponent {
  constructor(private toastService: ToastService) {}

  showToast() {
    this.toastService.show({ message: 'Save successful' });
  }
}
```

## API

## Accessibility

- Ensure that the dismiss button is accessible by keyboard.
- If color conveys important information, provide additional cues for users with color perception deficiencies.
