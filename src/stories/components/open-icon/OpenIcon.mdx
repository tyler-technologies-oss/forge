<Title />

This is a very simple component, and its only responsibility is to provide automatic rotation of the built-in chevron icon.

It works very well with other components (such as the expansion-panel) that need to display a rotating icon to denote the "open" or "closed" state of the component. The open-icon will listen for specific events to be dispatched and update its state automatically.

## Accessibility

- Ensure that the user can focus on the trigger element which activates and deactivates the open icon.
  - Ensure that the trigger element can be activated by keyboard.
- Ensure that the aria-expanded attribute is updated to reflect the state of the open icon, especially when toggling its state programmatically.
